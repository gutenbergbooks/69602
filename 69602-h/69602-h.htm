<p>“I <i>did</i> have ten cents, but I spent it,” explained
Ward Larue carefully.</p>

<p>Fred Williamson shook the bank he held in
his hand till the contents rattled.</p>

<p>“What did you spend it for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“A magnifying glass,” admitted Ward. “I
needed one.”</p>

<p>“I never saw such a boy for spending money,”
complained Fred. “You will end up in the poorhouse,
see if you don’t!”</p>

<p>“I guess if I paid ten cents in for Riddle Club
dues, it wouldn’t save me from going to the poorhouse,”
objected Ward.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it would, either,” said Jess
Larue, Ward’s sister.</p>

<p>Fred gazed at the circle in despair.</p>

<p>“You don’t any of you have the right idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
about these club dues,” he informed them. “You
seem to think I want the money to go off and
spend on myself. There’s no use in having a
treasurer, unless you’re willing to put something
in the treasury.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Fred! we are willing,” protested
Polly Marley, president of the Riddle Club. “Of
course we’re willing. The only reason I didn’t
pay to-day was because I didn’t have ten cents.”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t you?” said Fred, for all the
world, Ward thought, like the orators who spoke
in River Bend on the Fourth of July. “Why
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Polly was not awed by Fred’s rhetoric. She
laughed at him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have ten cents,” she giggled, “because
I loaned it to some one.”</p>

<p>“Artie, I suppose,” grumbled Fred. He considered
that his position as treasurer gave him the
right to ask any amount of personal questions
when dues were not forthcoming.</p>

<p>“No-o, it wasn’t Artie,” said Polly, still smiling.</p>

<p>“But Artie hasn’t paid his dues, either,” declared
Fred, fixing that small boy with a stern
eye. “Where’s your ten cents, Artie?”</p>

<p>Artie Marley, Polly’s brother, wriggled uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Now——” he stammered, “now, I had ten
cents. But I haven’t got it now. I’ll pay you
the next meeting, Fred.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the dime you had?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“I spent it for ink,” said Artie, solemnly. “If
I’m going to write a book, I have to write it in ink,
don’t I?”</p>

<p>Artie Marley was much given to reading books,
and now his modest desire was to write one.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need a whole bottle of ink
to write a book with,” said Fred, judiciously.
“You could have borrowed your mother’s ink and
saved the ten cents.”</p>

<p>Artie gazed at him with respect. He had had
the same thought himself, he declared.</p>

<p>“But when I took the bottle from Mother’s
desk, I spilled most of it on the stairs,” he confided.
“And so I had to take half of the new ink
I bought to fill her bottle up so she wouldn’t miss
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the next time,” Fred instructed him,
“you want to buy something, you pay your dues
first. You ought to have some sense of—of—some
sense of duty!” he concluded magnificently.</p>

<p>“I paid my dues!” exclaimed Fred’s twin sister,
Margy. “Didn’t I, Fred?”</p>

<p>The air with which Margy Williamson said this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
was too much for Jess. In spite of Polly’s warning
tug at her dress she spoke “right out in meeting,”
as her grandmother would have said.</p>

<p>“The reason you paid your dues, Margy Williamson,”
said Jess, clearly, “is because you borrowed
the money from Polly. That’s why she
couldn’t pay hers.”</p>

<p>Margy flushed and Fred frowned.</p>

<p>“I liked lending it to Margy,” said Polly, hurriedly.
“If I’d kept it, likely as not I would have
spent it. Margy’s going to pay me back next
week.”</p>

<p>“What I don’t understand,” announced Fred,
still frowning, “is why this club is so hard up.
We paid dues before we went to camp, and though
I won’t say you fell over yourselves to pay, I
didn’t have the trouble I’m having now.”</p>

<p>And Fred wiped his forehead with his handkerchief,
as though he found his duties almost too
much for him.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t pay dues all summer,” said
Polly, slowly, “and I think we forgot—If you get
out of a habit, you know, it’s hard to pick it up
again. Didn’t any one pay this time, Fred?”</p>

<p>“Only Margy,” said Fred, gloomily, “and she
borrowed the money.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” struck in Artie, quickly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fred, lamely, “I had to contribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to the post-card fund in school. That took my
dime.”</p>

<p>Ward and Artie fell into each other’s arms and
tumbled over on the floor. It was their way of
expressing delight.</p>

<p>“All the same,” declared Fred, raising his voice
above the laughter that greeted his confession,
“the next time this club meets, no one is going to
be allowed to leave this room without paying their
dues.”</p>

<p>Polly Marley was a tactful girl, and she knew
when to change a subject.</p>

<p>“We haven’t decided about Hallowe’en,” she
reminded them.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Fred, with relief. “Are
we going to have a party?”</p>

<p>“Mother doesn’t want Ward and me to dress
up and just go around,” said Jess. “So I think
we’d better have a party—just us, you know. We
don’t need any one else.”</p>

<p>The six members of the Riddle Club smiled at
one another. They had the best of good times
when “just us” and no outsiders were invited.
Weren’t they back from a summer in camp where
they proved their theory once more? Their
tanned faces and bright eyes showed what a
healthful summer it had been and their good
spirits spoke for their happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“It’s our turn to have a party,” said Margy
Williamson, eagerly. “Polly and Artie had us
Hallowe’en last year. We can have the kitchen
at our house and do anything we please.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d come to our house; but it’s all
right that way,” said Polly. “Shall we dress
up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it’s one bit of fun unless
we dress up and wear false-faces,” declared
Margy.</p>

<p>“We’ll know each other—can’t help it, with
only six of us,” demurred Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s all right—we can pretend to be
fooled,” said Jess Larue.</p>

<p>So it was decided to wear costumes and false-faces.</p>

<p>“Is the window open?” asked Polly, suddenly,
with a shiver.</p>

<p>“Closed,” reported Fred. “Gee! there is a
blast coming from somewhere.”</p>

<p>“The door’s swung open,” said Artie, rising to
close it.</p>

<p>“I think it’s awfully cold up here,” said Margy,
with customary frankness.</p>

<p>She wore a sweater, and so did the other girls,
but there was no denying the clubroom in the loft
of the barn was chilly.</p>

<p>“I’ve just thought!” went on Margy. “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
shall we do when it’s winter? We’ll freeze to
death up here.”</p>

<p>Jess looked distressed. The room was in her
father’s barn, and she had never considered the
advent of cold weather. The Riddle Club had
been formed in the spring, and the meetings had
been held—until the trip to camp—very comfortably
in the little room.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Polly now. “We can’t meet
here in winter. I don’t see what we are going to
do.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be winter for perfect ages,” declared
the hopeful Jess. “To-day is what Dora calls an
‘odd day.’ She was saying this morning that
we’ll probably have warm weather again. There’s
Indian summer—we haven’t had that yet. I
don’t think it’s really cold up here—do you?”</p>

<p>“Not really cold,” answered Polly. “But I’m
thinking of December. It will be cold then.”</p>

<p>“How did the horses and cows keep warm when
they stayed in this barn?” questioned Artie.
“Were they cold, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” retorted Ward. “Horses
and cows are never cold. They like cold
weather.”</p>

<p>“They keep each other warm,” said Fred, remembering
something he had heard. “The animal
heat in their bodies keeps them warm. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
farmers put blankets on their horses in the
winter time.”</p>

<p>“We could wrap up in blankets,” suggested
Polly.</p>

<p>“My mother is very particular about her
blankets,” said Margy. “She won’t let us take
them for tents, and she has to have them washed
a certain way. I don’t believe she would ever let
us have them out here in the barn.”</p>

<p>The other members of the Riddle Club were
equally sure that their mothers would object to
lending blankets for club meetings.</p>

<p>“Well, there ought to be some way,” said
Ward, thoughtfully. “Couldn’t we put in a furnace?”</p>

<p>“A furnace!” chorused the club. “What kind
of a furnace?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a furnace,” repeated Ward. “A regular
furnace, you know. That would keep us nice
and warm.”</p>

<p>“And where,” asked Fred, in some amazement,
“would we get the money to buy a furnace?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they cost much,” said Ward.
“Perhaps we have enough in your bank.”</p>

<p>Fred groaned in anguish and Polly laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Fred, bitterly. “Never want
to pay a cent in, but always willing to let it all go
out. Take the last penny in the bank—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
do you care? Why should dues worry you?
They’re only something to throw away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t spend your old dues, if you don’t want
to,” snapped Ward. “I don’t care whether you
put in a furnace or not; I’m never cold. It’s the
girls who are making a fuss.”</p>

<p>“A furnace costs a heap of money,” put in
Polly, wisely. “We never could afford that.
Besides, Mr. Larue wouldn’t let us. We might
set fire to the barn.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about that old gasolene stove that
Mother threw away last week?” suggested Artie.
“There’s nothing the matter with it, except it
leaks.”</p>

<p>“How much more do you want the matter with
it?” inquired Fred. “No gasolene stove comes
into this clubroom while I’m a member.”</p>

<p>“Then what shall we have?” asked Jess, sadly.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking that an electric heater
wouldn’t be so bad,” said Fred. “We could run
wires from the pole out in front and connect it
with the heater in here. We could light the barn
with the same current, too, and perhaps have
meetings at night. That would be fun, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“We could have our Hallowe’en party out
here,” cried Polly. “Think of having it in the
barn! Such heaps of fun!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“I don’t see where you expect to get the money,”
said Ward, coldly. “If we can’t touch those
precious old dues, how are you going to have electric
lights? Mr. Brewer had them put in his
barn last week and it cost more than fifty dollars.
He told Daddy so. They didn’t have to run the
wires as far as we shall, either.”</p>

<p>“Have we fifty dollars in the bank?” asked
Jess, curiously.</p>

<p>“Nowhere near,” Fred informed her. “I guess
that knocks out the electric heater idea. The only
thing I can see that we can do is to bring hot
water bottles with us, when it is cold.”</p>

<p>“We can have an ice hut and crawl inside,” giggled
Polly. “The Eskimos manage somehow,
and we will, too, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, it isn’t cold yet, not real cold,” argued
Jess. “And when it does snow, it will
bank the window and make it warmer. I don’t
believe we’ll need any kind of a heater or furnace.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be dark earlier every time, too,”
said Margy, who had a habit of looking ahead.
“In December it will be pitch dark long before
five o’clock. There’s Mrs. Pepper feeding her
hens now. I don’t believe it’s much after four.”</p>

<p>“Here, chick, chick, chick!” they could hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Mrs. Pepper, a neighbor, calling. “Here, chick,
chick, chick!”</p>

<p>“You never catch Carrie feeding those hens,”
said Jess, peering through the window. “Oh,
say, what do you know——” Her voice trailed
off without completing the sentence and her dark
eyes began to dance.</p>

<p>Polly was ready to ask her what she was thinking,
but the boys wanted the meeting adjourned.
So in a few minutes they were rushing down the
loft ladder, Ward having first carefully locked
the clubroom door.</p>

<p>“Remember, everybody come over to our house
after school to-morrow,” said Margy, as the group
separated at the door, the two Larues to go into
their house to supper and the other four to cross
the street to the Marley and the Williamson
houses, which were next door to each other.
“We’ll plan about the Hallowe’en party.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>PARTY PLANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Riddle Club</span> were very strict about not
using their clubroom for any purpose other than
club meetings. The six members were practically
inseparable, going to school together, playing and
working together most of the time outside of
school. But no matter what they did, or what
they wanted to play, unless they had a meeting of
their Riddle Club on hand, the clubroom was left
in perfect order and kept locked.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know all about the Riddle Club,
but if you don’t, a few words will introduce you.
It had been Polly Marley’s idea—this club—and
she was the president. Fred Williamson was
treasurer. Fred and Margy were twins, Artie
was Polly Marley’s younger brother, and Ward
and Jess Larue were brother and sister. Jess was
two years older than Ward. These children lived
in River Bend, a town on the Rocio River. Mr.
Larue was the president of the line of steamboats
that went up and down the river, carrying freight
and passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>In the first book of this series, named “The
Riddle Club at Home,” it has been told how the
Riddle Club flourished and spurred another group
of boys and girls to form a rival dub. This
was known as the Conundrum Club, and Carrie
Pepper was its president. They challenged the
members of the Riddle Club to a memorable riddle
contest and the latter came out victors.</p>

<p>Of course it was not to be thought of that a
summer should separate such close friends, so
what could be more natural than for the whole
six to go camping at Lake Bassing? They took
the Riddle Club with them, by-laws, president,
treasurer and all, and what happened to them
during a delightful two months, you may read in
the second book of the series, called “The Riddle
Club in Camp.” They camped on an island, and
above them lived a queer old hermit on another
island, while below their camp was another island
on which the Conundrum Club established themselves.</p>

<p>Things were bound to happen with such a lively
sextette around, and no one was disappointed.
Artie fell over a bluff. The Conundrum Club
suggested another riddle contest, which proved to
be not much more to their advantage than the
first. Then the children were able to solve the
mystery of the kind old hermit. Next, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
season was nearly over, they won the loving cup
in the water carnival. Add to all this the new
friends they made and the out-of-door glad days
they had, and you’ll understand that the summer
went too quickly to please them.</p>

<p>But schools will open in September, and the
Riddle Club had to come back to River Bend.
They were unexpectedly glad to get back to their
own homes and to the clubroom in the Larue barn.
This room had been given to them from the first
meeting, and to the furniture they had collected
for it, they were able to add several interesting
trophies from their summer in camp.</p>

<p>There was the beautiful silver loving cup; a
sketch of the entire club membership, made by
an artist and framed for them by Mrs. Marley;
the pennant they had flown in camp from their
flag pole; not to mention a gun for which Artie
had paid a dollar and which wouldn’t shoot but
which, he thought, gave a distinguished touch to
the room.</p>

<p>Jess mentioned the gun when, the next day, the
chums met at the Williamsons’ house to discuss
plans for their Hallowe’en party.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said soberly, “that we ought to
give a play Thanksgiving and let Artie be a Puritan
and carry his gun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Oh, let’s!” cried Margy, with enthusiasm.
“Let’s give a play! Mother gave me her old
black lace dress yesterday! I could wear that.”</p>

<p>If there was one thing Margy loved to do, it
was to “dress up” in grown people’s finery and
sweep about and pretend that she was a princess.</p>

<p>“Who’ll write the play?” demanded Fred.</p>

<p>“You and Polly,” said Ward so promptly that
Fred couldn’t help laughing.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d say something like that,” declared
Fred. “But you can change your ideas
right away. I know what we’re going to do
Thanksgiving, but it isn’t that.”</p>

<p>“Fred!” said Polly, in a warning voice. “You
told me you’d promised you wouldn’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Well, who’s telling?” demanded Fred. “I
haven’t said a word.”</p>

<p>Of course that drove the others frantic with
curiosity, but though they teased and coaxed and,
finally, Ward and Artie threw themselves on
Fred and got him down on the rug, not another
word could they shake from him.</p>

<p>“You’ll know all about it in plenty of time,” he
kept repeating.</p>

<p>“Does Polly know?” demanded Jess.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Fred; “not even Polly knows.
No one knows but me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Not Mother or Dad or Dora or——”
Ward was beginning in a sing-song tone, but Fred
put a hand gently over his mouth.</p>

<p>“Do keep still,” he said good-humoredly. “All
the mothers and fathers know. Now stop asking
questions.”</p>

<p>“You said no one knew except you alone,” Artie
protested.</p>

<p>“I meant no one in the Riddle Club except me,”
explained Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we have Hallowe’en to think
about,” said Polly, the tactful. “If we’re going
to wear costumes, it’s time we planned ’em.”</p>

<p>“I had a perfectly wonderful idea,” declared
Jess. “But I don’t know that I’ll tell it now; I
can keep secrets, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jess, darling, this isn’t a secret—it won’t
be one very long, at any rate,” said Polly, softly.
“We’ll all know soon, and it is something we’ll
just love to do. I’m sure of that. Tell us your
idea, Jess! Please do.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to resist Polly when she spoke
like that, and Jess yielded. As a matter of fact,
she had kept her wonderful idea to herself about
as long as she cared to. She had reached the
point where she was eager to share it with some
one.</p>

<p>“I think it would be a good idea,” she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
proudly, “to come to the party dressed like animals!”</p>

<p>They stared at her silently, and she was disappointed.
She had the plan so clearly in her own
mind, she thought it must be plain to them all.</p>

<p>“Yes, animals,” Jess repeated. “You know all
the people who go to Hallowe’en parties dress
like clowns and gypsies and dancing girls and
Brownies, and like that. Well, at our party, why
couldn’t we come dressed like—like chickens and
pigs and things?”</p>

<p>A shout of laughter interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Ward would make a handsome pig,” said
Artie, a little unkindly.</p>

<p>Ward was a very fat boy, with a round, good-natured
face that flushed at the slightest exertion.
He couldn’t run two blocks without getting out of
breath.</p>

<p>“I’ll be a pig,” said Ward now, “if you’ll be
the goat.”</p>

<p>Artie reached for him and they went over on
the rug in one of their friendly tussles. Mrs.
Williamson had given them the dining-room to
meet in, and had told them to have “all the fun
you want.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a chicken,” announced Jess,
fearful that some one else might want to take her
character. “I thought of it yesterday when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
were watching Mrs. Pepper feed her chickens.”</p>

<p>“Where will you get the feathers?” asked the
practical Margy.</p>

<p>“Oh, there must be feathers somewhere,” said
Jess, carelessly. “I’ll fix that part all right.”</p>

<p>“It would be kind of fun, wouldn’t it?” Fred
decided. “I wonder if we can get animal false-faces?
I’m going to ask Dad to-night.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson kept the department store in
River Bend, and he always carried a stock of
false-faces for Hallowe’en. Fred was sure that
if there were such things as “animal faces” his
father would have them.</p>

<p>“Let’s not tell what kind of animals we’re going
to be,” suggested Polly. “I love to be surprised.”</p>

<p>“You’d better tell your mother, Margy,” said
Ward. “If she sees a bunch of animals coming
to her house Hallowe’en night, she may think a
circus broke loose somewhere and not let us in.”</p>

<p>“You can’t scare my mother,” declared Margy,
proudly. “I don’t believe she’d be afraid of an
elephant, if she met him. Not on Hallowe’en,
at any rate.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have the house to ourselves—did
you know that?” said Fred. “Everything
we need for the party will be all ready in the
kitchen, and Mother is going to leave things to eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
in the pantry. She and Dad are going over to
Ward’s house. And Mr. and Mrs. Marley, too.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have a party of their own, I guess,”
said Jess. “I don’t believe it is much fun for
them to duck for apples and do the things we do.
They would rather listen to Mrs. Marley play
the piano and my mother play her violin than fuss
around with Hallowe’en games.”</p>

<p>“They’re going to have the radio set that night,
too,” Ward announced. “Fred said he’d take it
down from the clubroom and set it up in the
parlor. There’s a big musical program from
some city that night.”</p>

<p>Fred was the wireless expert of the Riddle Club.
He had first put up the handsome radio set the
club had been given for their share in the capture
of some radio thieves, and had taken it down and
set it up in camp that summer as well. Then,
when the time came to come home, he had taken
down the tree aerials and had brought the set
back to the Larue barn and set it up again in the
clubroom. Now for this special night he would
attach a loud speaker and arrange it in the Larue
parlor so that the listening parents might enjoy
the concert.</p>

<p>But the girls and boys could not talk long of
this grown-up affair when their own thrilling party
was yet to be arranged. They were used to planning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
their parties, and their mothers thought that
in this way they had twice the usual amount of
fun. Nearly every one can go to a party, if invited,
but not every one could plan a party if he
had to. The members of the Riddle Club did do
both nicely.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have all the games we can
think of,” said Margy. “Picking a ring out of a
plate of flour; trying to bite a marshmallow on a
string; ducking for apples, of course. What else,
Fred?”</p>

<p>“I know,” cried Artie, before Fred could answer.
“Go out in the garden and pull up a cabbage.
I read about it in a book.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>JESS HAS LUCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of the other members of the Riddle Club
stared at Artie in blank wonder.</p>

<p>“Cabbages?” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“What do we pull up a cabbage for?” Margy
demanded, curiously.</p>

<p>“To see whether you’ll be rich or poor,” said
Artie, as though that settled the matter.</p>

<p>“How will you know whether you’ll be rich and
poor?” Ward demanded.</p>

<p>“Not rich and poor,” Artie corrected him.
“Who ever heard of any one being rich and poor?
Rich <i>or</i> poor, silly.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” agreed Ward, amiably.
“Rich or poor then. How’ll we know we’re going
to be rich or poor by looking at a cabbage?”</p>

<p>Artie perceived that he would have to explain.</p>

<p>“You tell by the dirt,” he said seriously.</p>

<p>“The dirt?” echoed Margy. “What dirt?”</p>

<p>“The dirt on the roots of the cabbage,” said
Artie. “If a lot of dirt sticks, that’s a sign you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
going to be rich; if there isn’t much dirt, you’re
going to be poor.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Margy.</p>

<p>“I think that will be fun,” said Jess, briskly.</p>

<p>“I call it a fool stunt, but we’ll try it,” Fred
decided. “Know any more, Artie?”</p>

<p>Artie thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“I know about making wishes,” he said, and
paused.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t stop,” Polly urged. “Go on and
tell us.”</p>

<p>Artie was as fond of talking as any of the rest,
but he had an odd habit of stopping suddenly,
just when his listeners thought he was well
started.</p>

<p>“You make a wish,” he began again, “and then
you must go upstairs and down twice, outdoors
and all around the house and around the barn—Of
course, Mr. Williamson hasn’t any barn,”
Artie interrupted himself to say; “but the summerhouse
will do, I guess. The book said an ‘outdoor
building,’ and a summerhouse must be an
outdoor building. Say, Fred, isn’t a summerhouse
an outdoor building?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it is,” the impatient Fred assured
him. “Hurry up, Artie, I’m going to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“Where was I?” asked Artie, calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“The wishes,” Margy prodded. “We make a
wish and walk upstairs and downstairs twice and
around the house——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember,” said Artie. “Well,
you walk around the house and the barn and then
you come in again.”</p>

<p>“Then what happens?” asked Ward.</p>

<p>“Your wishes come true,” Artie said.</p>

<p>“Well, I call that too queer for anything,” remarked
Jess, and the others were inclined to agree
with her.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how walking around like that can
make wishes come true,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“It’s the not speaking,” explained Artie. “That
does it.”</p>

<p>Polly stared at her brother.</p>

<p>“The—the <i>what</i>?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Not speaking. You know, even if some one
calls to you or asks a question, you can’t say a
word till you’ve been all around and come back,”
said Artie.</p>

<p>“You never said anything about that,” Margy
informed him. “Can’t we speak while we’re
walking around the house?”</p>

<p>“My, no, not a word,” said Artie, placidly.
“After you make the wish, you can’t say another
word till you’ve been up- and downstairs and
around the house and barn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Let’s do that! It sounds awfully spooky,”
declared Margy.</p>

<p>“Be sure you find out about the false-faces to-night,
Fred,” said Polly. “If your father hasn’t
any, we’ll have to make some.”</p>

<p>Nothing ever daunted Polly. If she could not
find what she wanted ready-made, she made it
herself.</p>

<p>“And another thing,” said Margy. “Being the
Riddle Club, why can’t we ask some riddles? I
mean short ones—one apiece.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jess.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get some about animals,” suggested
Artie.</p>

<p>“Oh, any kind of riddle will do,” declared the
president of the club.</p>

<p>The plans for the party made, the six chums
made fudge as a grand wind-up to the afternoon.
They went home to supper, where the candy apparently
made little difference in their hearty appetites.</p>

<p>Hallowe’en was not far away, and if their
animal costumes were to be made, it was necessary
to start work upon them at once. Fred’s
father had almost every kind of false-face manufactured,
but he had no animal ones. Perhaps,
as Jess proudly said, they were the first to dress
up as animals for Hallowe’en. Anyway, Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
would have to make the faces. That was clear.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of laughing and whispering
going on every afternoon after school in
each of the three houses on Elm Road. Artie and
Ward shared some joke together, and they might
be heard shouting and laughing soon after they
had turned the key in Ward’s or Artie’s room
door, as the case might be.</p>

<p>“I think they’re dancing,” Jess confided to
Polly. “They shake the ceiling of the dining-room.
Ward’s room is right over the dining-room,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Artie hates to dance,” Polly returned. “You
couldn’t make him. No, it’s something else. I
don’t know what. They shake the house when
they’re over here, too.”</p>

<p>For not even Polly was to know what animals
were represented. Every one was so determined
to keep his or her costume a secret that it had been
decided that “any kind of face” was to be worn.</p>

<p>“Of course they won’t match,” said Jess. “But
that will be even more fun.”</p>

<p>Jess was having a thrilling time trying to get
her costume together. She had set her heart on
going as a chicken, and every one knows that if
there is one thing a chicken cannot do without, it
is feathers.</p>

<p>“I can manage the wings,” she confided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Dora, the good-natured maid in her mother’s
kitchen, “because I can use those two turkey
wings we had left from last Thanksgiving. But
where will I get the rest of the feathers?”</p>

<p>Good fortune smiled unexpectedly on Jess. At
least, she thought it was good fortune. Passing
Mrs. Pepper’s house one morning on her way to
the store for her mother—it was Saturday—Jess
spied a barrel standing at the edge of the drive.
It was filled with soft, fluffy chicken feathers!</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Pepper, are you throwing those
feathers <i>away</i>?” asked Jess, in the tone of one
who has found a neighbor tossing out a gold mine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper was raking leaves from her lawn.
Carrie usually stayed in bed late Saturday mornings,
and she was not up yet.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Jess, I put that barrel out for the
junk man. He comes through town on Saturdays,”
answered Mrs. Pepper. “Those feathers
aren’t good enough to save for pillows, and I don’t
like to burn them.”</p>

<p>“Could—could I have them?” asked Jess, her
eyes shining.</p>

<p>“My lands, child! what do you want with
them?” exclaimed Mrs. Pepper. “Take them
and welcome, of course; but I’ll need the barrel
back. Barrels are scarce, and I like to make
mine last.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“I’ll bring the barrel right back,” promised
Jess, joyfully. “Thank you ever so much, Mrs.
Pepper.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper stared at her as the small girl began
to roll the barrel toward her side lawn. The
Pepper property joined Mr. Larue’s, and Jess
had not far to go. The feathers, of course,
weighed almost nothing, and the task was not difficult,
but Mrs. Pepper stood racking her brains
to think what use Jess could have for the down
and bits of feathers she had thrown away. She
was still standing there ten minutes later when
Carrie came out.</p>

<p>“Jess Larue took those feathers?” Carrie repeated,
when her mother told her. “I don’t see
what on earth she wants them for! Why didn’t
you make her tell you before you gave her the
barrel?”</p>

<p>“I believe in minding my own affairs,” said Mrs.
Pepper, tartly.</p>

<p>She kept a great many chickens and sold them
dressed; that is, killed and with the feathers taken
off. Her good feathers she saved for pillows,
but the stuff that filled the barrel was down from
young chickens and broken feathers that were of
no use to her.</p>

<p>Jess rolled her barrel up to the side door of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the house and reached the hall before Dora spied
her.</p>

<p>“Where you going, Jess, with that dirty old
barrel?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I’m taking it up to my room,” replied Jess.</p>

<p>“What’s in it—let me look,” replied Dora.
“Feathers! Jess, for goodness’ sake, roll that
barrel outside, quick! If your mother was to
catch you scattering those nasty little pin feathers
all over the house, she’d tell you a thing or two!”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to scatter them,” Jess argued.
“Help me carry the barrel up to my room, will
you, Dora? I have to take it back.”</p>

<p>When Dora understood that the barrel was to
go back to Mrs. Pepper, she was more determined
than ever that Jess should not take it up to her
room.</p>

<p>“I know exactly what you’d do, Jess,” Dora
said. “You’d dump those feathers out on your
bedroom floor and take the empty barrel back;
and in less than five minutes, every rug and carpet
in this house, to say nothing of the chairs and the
sofas, would have pin feathers sticking in them.”</p>

<p>“Well, where can I put them?” asked Jess,
realizing that unless Dora was willing to help her
she could not hope to get the barrel up the stairs.
“I have to have these feathers for Hallowe’en,
Dora.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Take them out in the barn, to be sure,” said
Dora. “Why you and Ward don’t want to play
in the barn, beats me. Many a child would be
thankful for such a light, clean place to stay in.
You can make all the noise you want, too, and
do as you please out there. And you’re forever
hanging around the house.”</p>

<p>“It’s cold,” said Jess, absently, but her mind
was busy with another problem. She had remembered
that she needed flour paste.</p>

<p>“If I take the feathers out to the barn, Dora,”
she said coaxingly, “how about some flour paste?
Let me make some?”</p>

<p>“You’re too hard on the flour barrel,” declared
Dora, good-naturedly. “Be off to the barn now
and leave your barrel there; then go and get the
soap your mother promised me and I’ll have the
paste ready for you when you come back.”</p>

<p>Jess was willing, and she rolled the barrel out
to the barn. She was glad that Ward was over
with Artie Marley, for it gave her an opportunity
to make her Hallowe’en costume without an audience.
She dumped the feathers on the floor of
the barn, not minding in the least that they flew
about and lighted, many of them, in her hair and
on her blouse and skirt, then rolled the empty barrel
back to the Pepper driveway.</p>

<p>Carrie saw her and called to her to wait, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Jess shouted that she was going to the store and
ran off quickly. It was not part of her plan to
have Carrie’s sharp eyes and Carrie’s quick tongue
ferret out her secret.</p>

<p>True to her promise, Dora had a generous
basin of flour paste ready for Jess when she came
back from the store, and the girl took it gratefully
and went out to the barn. She made several
trips to the house for things she needed, scissors,
newspapers, and a paper of pins were among
them, but at last she was evidently equipped, for
she stayed in the barn.</p>

<p>“Where’s Jess?” asked Polly and Margy, half
an hour later, at the Larue back door.</p>

<p>“Out in the barn—at least, she was a little while
ago,” answered Dora. “I haven’t heard a word
from her since I made her a bowl of flour paste.”</p>

<p>Polly and Margy went out to the barn. The
sliding door was pushed half-way open, and there
on the barn floor they beheld a remarkable sight.
They stared, wondering what it could be.</p>

<p>“Jess!” called Polly, uncertainly. “Jess! is
that you?”</p>

<small>HALLOWE’EN FUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span> away,” whispered Margy. “That isn’t
Jess.”</p>

<p>But it was Jess. The rolling figure sat up and
stared at them with Jess’s own brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Jess, none too cordially.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing?” asked
Margy, more frankly than politely.</p>

<p>“I’m busy,” answered Jess.</p>

<p>“You’re a sight—isn’t she, Polly?” said Margy.</p>

<p>Polly didn’t wish to agree, but the truth was
that Jess was the most remarkable looking girl
she had ever seen. She seemed to be covered
with feathers—her hair and face and hands.
They were on her shoes, her stockings, and parts
of her dress. There was almost as much dirt and
dust mixed with the feathers as there was flour
paste, and that had evidently been used in liberal
quantities.</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you doing?” asked Polly, helplessly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know,” said Jess, “I’m making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
my Hallowe’en costume. Only these mean
old feathers aren’t much good,” she added fretfully.
“They won’t stay stuck.”</p>

<p>She went on to explain that she had cut a
chicken out of newspapers—“both sides and sewed
it in the middle”—and had spread the paste over
this. The plan was to roll in the feathers with
this on and in this way the pattern would be covered
with feathers which would dry on. Then,
with the addition of the turkey wings, Jess would
be ready for the party.</p>

<p>“I have a pair of bright yellow stockings I never
wore, and I am going to paint my shoes yellow,
too,” she announced, in a burst of confidence.</p>

<p>Polly wanted to laugh, but she was afraid of
hurting Jess’s feelings.</p>

<p>“It looks pretty messy just now,” said Polly.
“But perhaps when it dries it will be all right.
You’re taking a lot of trouble, aren’t you, Jess?”</p>

<p>“Well, I like things to be right,” admitted Jess.
“I think it will be fun to have animals at the party.
Margy, will you stick a handful of feathers on
that bare place? Here, put some more paste on
first.”</p>

<p>Margy didn’t want to put her hands in the
feathers, so Polly had to come to the rescue.
Then she helped Jess take the paper off, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
difficult, for it was wet and heavy with paste and
easily torn.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t wear it again till the night of the
party,” Polly cautioned the designer. “You’ll
wear it out, if you’re not careful.”</p>

<p>“I won’t touch it till Hallowe’en,” promised
Jess. “But now you’ve seen mine, I think you
ought to tell me what you’re going to wear,” she
declared.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a leopard,” said Polly, instantly.
“It’s because we had some spotted flannel
in the house.”</p>

<p>“And Mother is going to lend me her old astrakhan
coat, so I can be a lamb,” said Margy. “I
think lambs are lovely. I wouldn’t want to be
any kind of homely animal, even for fun.”</p>

<p>Jess’s dark eyes grew round with curiosity.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose the boys are going to
wear?” she asked.</p>

<p>But no one knew, and up to the night of the
party no one had found out. It had been agreed
among the six friends that each was to go alone
to the Williamson house, so it happened that the
three girls and Mr. and Mrs. Williamson were
already in the big, roomy kitchen, where the party
was to be, when some one knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“That’s Fred! I know it is!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Margy. “I just heard him go down the front
stairs and out. He’s come around to the back
door.”</p>

<p>Margy was wearing her mother’s woolly coat,
and with her shiny black shoes and black silk
gloves—to represent the forefeet—made a very
cunning and attractive little lamb—till one’s
glance reached her face. Her false-face was
that of an old witch, and the contrast between this
grinning old-woman face and the woolly young
lamb was too much for Mr. Williamson. He
had gone into fits of laughter as soon as he saw
Margy.</p>

<p>The arrival of Polly, in spotted flannel that
covered her hands and feet much as a sleeping
garment would, her face hidden behind a
“Brownie” false-face, made Mr. Williamson
laugh, too. But when Jess arrived, Mrs. Williamson
was really alarmed about him. He
laughed so hard he had to take out his handkerchief
and wipe his eyes.</p>

<p>Even Polly and Margy had to laugh at Jess.
She wore her feather suit, as she called the paper
and feather costume, and she had rigged up the
turkey wings with string so that they flapped—sometimes—when
she pulled the string. As the
nearest thing to a chicken’s head she could get
in a false-face, she had chosen a mask with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
extremely long and hooked nose that, she fondly
hoped, looked like a chicken’s beak. She had
taken an old pair of shoes and covered them with
bright yellow paint, buttons and all.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Williamson were only waiting to
greet the guests before going over to spend the
evening at the Larue house. Answering the
knock at the door, Mr. Williamson opened it and
a kangaroo leaped into the room. For a moment
the girls were startled, and then they saw that it
was Fred.</p>

<p>“I think that’s a fine costume, Fred,” said Polly.
“Did you make it?”</p>

<p>“Mother helped,” replied Fred, hopping
around the kitchen the better to show off his
brown flannel suit and long tail. It covered his
head and eyes so that he didn’t need a mask, and
when he crouched in a sitting position, Polly assured
him that he looked exactly like the pictures
of kangaroos they had seen in their school geographies.</p>

<p>Rat-a-tat-tat! went a knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Bet that’s Artie,” said Fred, confidently.</p>

<p>“Ward, more likely,” declared Jess. “He was
getting ready when I started to come.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson opened the door, and they all
leaned forward to look.</p>

<p>First a long, long neck stretched itself into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
kitchen, then an ungainly, rather square body,
mounted on four legs, followed. This queer-looking
creature was spotted in circles, and had a long,
thin tail.</p>

<p>“A giraffe!” cried Jess, guessing first.</p>

<p>“Artie and Ward! Well, what do you know
about that!” shouted Fred. “Why didn’t you
tell a fellow?”</p>

<p>“Wanted to surprise you,” croaked the giraffe.
“Guess we did it.”</p>

<p>And to Fred’s amazement, the long neck twisted
several times around his own neck in what was
meant to be an affectionate embrace.</p>

<p>“Here—let go of me—get out!” cried Fred,
trying to back away. “What kind of a neck have
you, a rubber one?”</p>

<p>The girls giggled and Mr. Williamson untangled
the long neck carefully.</p>

<p>“Don’t let it rip,” begged the giraffe. “If it
comes unsewed the whole thing will be spoiled.
That’s the old rubber hose in that neck.”</p>

<p>“So that’s what you’ve been doing so long,”
said Polly. “I see! That’s why you were shaking
the ceiling.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p036.jpg" alt="A GIRAFFE! CRIED JESS, GUESSING FIRST"></div>
<p class="caption">“A GIRAFFE!” CRIED JESS, GUESSING FIRST.</p>

<p>“Well, if you think it’s easy to walk in this,
you ought to try it,” said Artie’s voice. “Ward
had to be the front because he is taller, and I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the back legs. At first we walked into each other
and couldn’t turn corners without making a mess
of it. But how we do fine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it is safe to leave this
menagerie or not, Mother,” said Mr. Williamson,
smiling. “But we won’t be so far away that we
can’t get back if we’re needed. Now, youngsters,”
he added to the children, “go as far as
you like and have all the fun you want. But don’t
go off the grounds and don’t set the house on fire.
Fred, I trust your good sense to know when to
stop.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” cried the animals, crowding to the
door. “Good-bye. We’re going to have a lovely
party.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Williamson looked back and
laughed. The light from the kitchen streamed
through the doorway and showed a wild-looking
group on the porch.</p>

<p>“I’m glad they didn’t want any others,” said
Mrs. Williamson, as they reached the Larue
house. “They get on so well together that they
do not really need any more to make a party.”</p>

<p>Left alone, Margy and Fred, as host and hostess,
announced that the games would begin at
once. Of course the false-faces had to come off
and the gloves, too, and Fred had to fold back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his brown hood, while Artie and Ward had to
step “out of their skin,” as they put it, to duck for
apples.</p>

<p>This was not Ward’s favorite pastime, for it
always made him gasp dreadfully; but he wouldn’t
beg off, and manfully went groping about under
the water till he nearly choked. He never succeeded
in getting hold of an apple, but Fred
brought up two and Polly one, while Jess and
Artie each lifted one by the stem, merely to drop
it before it reached the surface.</p>

<p>Then they tackled the swaying marshmallow on
the string, and most of them were liberally coated
with the snowy powder before Margy grasped
the mallow in her strong little white teeth and
swallowed it and nearly swallowed the string,
too.</p>

<p>“Now the plate of flour,” commanded Fred,
when the marshmallow was gone. “Put your
hands behind you, every one, and do your best.”</p>

<p>Ward made a desperate effort, but, unfortunately,
opened his eyes when his face was buried
in the flour and coughed and sputtered so much as
he tried to wink them clear again, that Fred pulled
him out in great alarm.</p>

<p>“Let me try,” begged Artie.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, shut his eyes, and
ducked into the flour for the hidden ring. Alas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
he had found the ring and was ready to take it
in his teeth when he found he could not hold his
breath another minute. He let it out in one great
rush, and the flour flew in all directions, most of it
landing on the interested five standing near.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Margy, kindly, for Artie
looked distressed. “We have plenty more flour,
and Mother said she didn’t care how much mess
we made in the kitchen. It’s easy to clean.”</p>

<p>So the ring was hidden in the flour again, and
Jess tried and failed to find it. Polly was the
one who finally brought it to light.</p>

<p>“And now I guess it is time we had the riddles,”
said the president of the club. “Each girl is to
ask a boy a riddle and then each boy is to do the
same thing to a girl. Jess, you can start if
you want to.”</p>

<p>“All right. Artie, what word may be pronounced
quicker by adding a syllable to it?”</p>

<p>“That’s a real hard one,” grumbled Artie.
“Why didn’t you make it easier?”</p>

<p>“I know that one,” shouted Ward.</p>

<p>“Guess, Artie,” said Polly. “Hurry, we don’t
want to lose time over the riddles.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s fast, because you add E-R and then
it’s faster.”</p>

<p>“Almost right,” replied Jess. “The word is
quick. Add E-R and you have quicker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“I’ve one for you, Ward,” said Margy. “Why
is an egg like a young colt?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got you, Margy! The answer is because
neither can be used until broken.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—broken?” asked Jess.
“I mean of a colt?”</p>

<p>“Why, a colt is broken to harness,” explained
Margy, impatiently. “They are of no account
until they’re broken.”</p>

<p>“Now it’s my turn,” said Polly. “Fred, here is
a real mannish riddle: What is the best bet made—one
covering everything?”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s some bet—to cover everything.
Must be the heavens.”</p>

<p>“Is that your guess?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re wrong. The best bet that covers
everything is the alphabet.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Why didn’t I think of that?”</p>

<p>“Now you boys must ask us girls. Fred, go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask you, Polly. Here is a stinger:
What’s the difference between a brand new ten-cent
piece and an old-fashion quarter?”</p>

<p>“The difference is exactly fifteen cents,” replied
Polly, placidly.</p>

<p>“Wow! I guess you read the same riddle
book I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Here is one for you, Margy,” said Artie.
“Why is a lollipop like a horse?”</p>

<p>“When he’s the same color,” said Margy,
quickly.</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t the answer. A lollipop is like
a horse because the more you lick it the faster it
goes.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ward, you ask the last riddle,” said
Polly. “Then we’ll go on with our Hallowe’en
fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jess, what is the ugliest hood ever
brought to light?”</p>

<p>“Ugly hood? Oh, lots of them are ugly.
Sadie Drew has a hood that is a sickly green and
has bright red——”</p>

<p>“Never mind all that. What is positively the
ugliest hood ever thought of?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What hood is it?”</p>

<p>“A falsehood,” cried Ward, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess that’s right.”</p>

<p>“Now everybody has asked a riddle, let us go
on with our Hallowe’en stunts,” said Polly. “Let
us start on the wishes.”</p>

<p>“Everybody make a wish,” directed Artie.
“Then we’ll go upstairs and down and around
the summerhouse and the real house. Remember,
nobody is to say a word.”</p>

<p>They made their wishes hurriedly and silently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and then, Fred leading the way, they started.
They kept rather close together, for each time
they went up- and downstairs—and they had to do
that twice—their shadows made such queer shapes
on the wall that they looked positively spooky.</p>

<p>Artie and Ward clumped along in the giraffe
suit, and the leopard and kangaroo looked almost
real. Each one wanted to say to some one else,
“Oh, doesn’t it make you feel jumpy?” but that,
of course, would have broken the spell.</p>

<p>When they had been up and down the stairs
twice, Fred led the way outdoors. Then, indeed,
they did keep close together, for the moon was
crossed by scudding clouds and the dry leaves, rattling
over the dried grass, made funny, little
scratching noises. Polly said afterward that she
would not have been surprised to have seen a
witch come jumping out at her from behind the
summerhouse.</p>

<p>Around the house they trailed, and around the
summerhouse, in perfect silence. Back to the
house they went and into the brightly lighted
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Margy, in great relief. “I guess
our wishes are coming true. No one said a word.”</p>

<p>“I almost did, though,” declared Jess. “I
nearly yelled. Didn’t you see something back of
the summerhouse?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Oh, Jess, you’re getting nervous,” said Fred.
“There wasn’t anything there. We walked all
around it.”</p>

<p>“It was inside,” replied Jess, glancing fearfully
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a thing there—not a thing,” insisted
Fred. “You imagined it. Come on now,
let’s go pull up the cabbages and see if we’re going
to be rich or poor. Then we’ll have the eats.”</p>

<p>“Jess,” whispered Polly, as they streamed out
again, headed for the garden patch, “I thought I
saw something in the summerhouse, too.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>TABLES TURNED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jess</span> and Polly looked over their shoulders as
they walked to the garden, which was at one side
of the house, but the others marched briskly along.
In the summer Mr. Williamson had a flourishing
“truck patch,” and even now there were some late
vegetables still in the ground. The patch was
protected from frost, and Fred sometimes boasted
of getting cabbage or parsnips “from the garden”
as late as Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>“Now, how do we do this stunt, Artie?” asked
Fred, when they had reached the row of cabbages.
“You pull one and show us.”</p>

<p>Artie pulled a fine large cabbage and exhibited
its roots to the interested audience.</p>

<p>“Lots of dirt on it,” he pointed out—indeed, in
his zeal, he had loosened perhaps half a peck of
earth, most of which clung to the roots—“and
that shows I will be very rich some day.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Fred will,” said Polly, mischievously.
“That dirt is from his father’s garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“It’s just a sign,” explained Artie, hastily.</p>

<p>Margy stooped and brought up another cabbage,
but as she lifted it she shook it carefully and
nearly all the dirt fell off.</p>

<p>“There goes your fortune!” cried Jess. “You
mustn’t shake it, Margy.”</p>

<p>“It’s too heavy with all that dirt on it,” Margy
complained.</p>

<p>“Well, if there’s a bag of gold at the bottom
of this one, it’s going to stay right there,” announced
Polly, tugging at the nearest cabbage.</p>

<p>A shriek from Margy startled her. She let
go the cabbage in time to look up and see a tall
white figure land in the patch, apparently from the
skies. They all saw it at the same instant, and,
cabbages forgotten, they rushed madly for the
house. Margy was crying wildly, Polly pulled
Jess along by the hand, and poor Ward and Artie
fell down, but scrambled up again and managed to
get over the ground in spite of their costume,
which was never designed for a running suit.
They reached the back porch, stumbled pell-mell
up the steps and into the kitchen. Margy closed
the door with a bang that shook the house.</p>

<p>“Oh-oo!” she wept, her teeth chattering.
“What was it? What was it?”</p>

<p>“I think—I think it was a ghost,” quavered
Jess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“It was a million feet high—almost,” said
Artie. “Did you see how it was waving its
arms?”</p>

<p>“There are no such things as ghosts,” declared
Polly, firmly. “It couldn’t have been a ghost,
could it——” She had meant to say, “Could it,
Fred?” but at that moment she made an alarming
discovery.</p>

<p>Fred wasn’t in the kitchen with them!</p>

<p>“Where’s Fred?” asked Polly, anxiously.
“Didn’t he come in? Has any one seen him?”</p>

<p>“The ghost has carried him off!” cried Margy,
in alarm. “He’s gone! Oh, my, what will
Mother say?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a ghost,” said Polly again. “I tell
you, there are no ghosts. And if it was a ghost,
it couldn’t carry Fred off—a ghost can’t carry anything.”</p>

<p>“You just said there aren’t any ghosts,” objected
Margy.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean if there were ghosts, they
couldn’t carry any one off,” Polly explained.</p>

<p>“Then where is Fred?” asked Artie, quite as
though he thought Polly would be able to tell him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Polly admitted. “You don’t
suppose he could have fallen down a hole somewhere,
do you? I don’t remember having seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
him after I saw the ghost—and that was just before
I started to pull up the cabbage.”</p>

<p>No one remembered having seen Fred.</p>

<p>“But then,” added Ward, “I couldn’t see anything,
really. The flannel slipped down over my
eyes and I couldn’t see where I was going, let alone
any one else. I don’t know where Fred went.”</p>

<p>“I read once about a man who fell down a
canyon and was never seen again,” contributed
Artie, helpfully.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any canyon for Fred to fall down,”
declared Jess, with some scorn. “I think we
ought to go over and get Mr. Williamson, though;
perhaps he could find Fred.”</p>

<p>“But if we go outdoors, that ghost—or whatever
it is—will grab us,” said Margy, fearfully.</p>

<p>It was what they were all thinking, and no one
wanted to be the first to volunteer to go over to
the Larue house and summon aid.</p>

<p>Ward looked at Artie. They did not think of
themselves as brave, but it really required the
strongest kind of courage for them to make the
suggestion that Ward presently offered.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out and look all over the garden,
Artie and I,” he said. “There’s no use in scaring
Mrs. Williamson; we may find Fred and then
everything will be all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“I can come, too, and hold a lantern for you,”
offered Polly, bravely. “I’d like to do it.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t come. Girls shouldn’t—shouldn’t—expose
themselves to danger,” said
Ward, feeling remarkably like a policeman—or
as he thought a policeman must feel. “But I’d
like a lantern. Where is there one, Margy?”</p>

<p>“Down cellar,” said Margy, rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to go down cellar,” announced Jess,
flatly. “Goodness only knows what’s down there.
It’s as dark as pitch.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go down,” suggested Polly. “You
can turn on the light at the head of the stairs,
can’t you, Margy?”</p>

<p>Most of the houses in River Bend were wired
for electricity, and there was a switch at the head
of the Williamsons’ cellar stairs. Margy pressed
the button, but even the flood of light which lit the
cellar did not give any of them any great confidence.
They went down the steps slowly, and not
for anything in the world would they have looked
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>Margy found the lantern behind the furnace,
and, as they had not brought matches, there was
no reason for staying, since to light it they would
have to go back to the kitchen. Jess led the way
upstairs, and as she gained the top step, she cried
out. Fred was just closing the outside door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Hello!” he said comfortably. “Where’ve
you all been?”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” Margy countered.
“You scared us pretty near into fits. We thought
the ghost had caught you.”</p>

<p>“Ward and I were coming out to hunt for you,”
Artie said, waving the lantern. “We went down
cellar to get this.”</p>

<p>“Huh, that wasn’t a ghost,” replied Fred. “If
you’d hung around a little, the way I did, you
would have found it out pretty quick.”</p>

<p>Margy switched off the cellar light and shut the
door.</p>

<p>“What was it, if it wasn’t a ghost?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Joe Anderson,” was Fred’s surprising reply.
“He thought he’d be smart. You haven’t been
crying, have you, Margy?”</p>

<p>“Only a little,” said Margy, hastily.</p>

<p>“She thought something had happened to you,”
said Polly. “What did you do, Fred? And
weren’t you frightened?”</p>

<p>“I was at first,” acknowledged Fred. “That
white thing came up on us so quietly, it rather took
my breath away. But when you all started to
shriek and run, I heard Joe Anderson laugh. I’d
know his snicker if I heard it in China. So I hid
behind the pear tree. I thought I’d get a chance
to punch his nose for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Did you?” chorused Artie and Ward interestedly.</p>

<p>“Well, no, I didn’t,” said Fred. “He followed
you up to the porch steps and then came back,
but Albert Holmes came out of the summerhouse—he
must have been hiding there with Joe—and
they began talking. And they’re going to try to
play another trick on us in a few minutes. I
heard them planning it. They want to wait till
we get quieted down from this scare, and then Joe
is going to ring the doorbell. He thinks whoever
comes to the door will have a fit when they
see a giant ghost.”</p>

<p>“A giant ghost?” repeated Polly.</p>

<p>“Yes, a giant ghost. Albert is going to sit on
Joe’s shoulder and that will make the ghost about
eight feet high,” said Fred. “I wish I could think
of something to do that would make them feel
cheap.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go upstairs and pour water out of the
window on them when they ring the bell,” suggested
Jess, excitedly.</p>

<p>Fred shook his head.</p>

<p>“I wonder——” he said slowly. “Yes, I do
believe it will work!”</p>

<p>“What will work?” demanded Margy, eagerly.
“What will work, Fred?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll step into the first half of the giraffe,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
explained Fred, “and Artie can manage the back
feet—Ward will get out of breath too quickly to
do what I want done. When the bell rings, we’ll
go out the back door and amble around to the
front of the house and just wrap Mr. Ghost lovingly
around with that nice, long, rubber-hose
neck. That ought to give our friends a thrill.
They won’t know what has them in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” approved Polly. “I think that’s a
fine plan. Hurry, Ward, and let Fred get into
your half; the bell may ring any minute.”</p>

<p>Ward would have liked to have guided the
giraffe’s neck himself, but he knew as well as Fred
that excitement took his breath away as quickly
as running. Fred had the longer arms, too, and
would be able to give a longer reach to the animal’s
long neck.</p>

<p>Fred had hardly slipped into the flannel casing
and drawn it tightly about him and Artie was
practicing his best giraffe step, when the bell over
the door leading into the front hall rang sharply.
Every one jumped, though it was a noise they
were expecting.</p>

<p>“Stay right where you are,” Fred directed. “If
Joe sees you through the curtains or the glass
door, he’ll be suspicious. Come on, Artie, we’ll
have to hurry.”</p>

<p>He and Artie loped down the back steps and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
sped around the side of the house. A cautious
look showed Fred a towering ghost standing on
the front steps, waiting patiently. Tiptoeing, he
and Artie stole up to it and before the ghost knew
what was happening, a long slim, tight coil was
fastened about it.</p>

<p>“Ow! Help! Take it away!” shrieked Joe Anderson’s
voice. “Quick, Albert, take it off!
Help! Something’s got me!”</p>

<p>Albert was sitting on Joe’s shoulders, and in
his terror and excitement he began to kick wildly,
hammering the unfortunate Joe on the face and
shoulders unmercifully. Fred couldn’t unwind
the length of hose—though he tried—because the
end was pinioned under one of Albert’s arms, and
the more the two boys who formed the ghost
struggled, the tighter the coils seemed to grow.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” called Joe, beside himself with
fear.</p>

<p>“Ow! Joe! Joe! It’s choking me!” screamed
poor Albert, twisting and turning madly, for his
pillow case had slipped too far over his head and
he felt as though he was smothering.</p>

<p>The other children had rushed to the door when
they heard the racket. Across the street in the
Larue house lights were blazing through the windows
as the shades were run up, for the noise had
reached the grown-ups there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Take it off, Fred,” called Artie. “Hurry—take
it off! I can’t see a thing in here.”</p>

<p>“It—won’t—come—off!” gasped Fred. “Don’t
you see me pulling?”</p>

<p>He took a step backward, his foot caught one
of Artie’s, and they went down together, dragging
the kicking ghost on top of them. When Mr.
Williamson and Mr. Larue and Mr. Marley
reached the spot a few minutes later, to their
astonishment they saw what looked like a brown
and white animal with spots thrashing about on
the ground and apparently fitted with dozens of
legs and arms.</p>

<small>POLLY’S PROBLEM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As this</span> queer animal flopped about, muffled
cries and shouts came from it. Dancing around
it were four little figures in the wildest state of
excitement.</p>

<p>“Here, here, what’s all this?” asked Mr. Williamson.
“You’ll have the whole town here in
another minute. What’s that on the ground?”</p>

<p>“Fred!” said Margy.</p>

<p>“Artie!” cried Polly.</p>

<p>“Joe Anderson and Albert Holmes,” piped
out Ward.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see if we can sort them out,” said
Mr. Williamson, who seemed to understand.</p>

<p>He grasped a kicking leg and Mr. Marley
caught a waving arm. As for Mr. Larue, he took
a whole handful of spots, and that proved to be
most of Joe Anderson.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys stopped twisting and turning,
they found they were not so badly mixed as
they had thought. They climbed out of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
wrappings, a little the worse for wear, but not
much.</p>

<p>“Think you’re smart, don’t you?” growled Joe
Anderson.</p>

<p>“The hose twisted,” explained Fred, with a
grin. “Bet you were scared.”</p>

<p>“My mother will be as mad—as mad—as anything!”
sputtered Albert Holmes. “She told me
not to take her sheets and pillow case, and now
look at them!”</p>

<p>Alas, for Mrs. Holmes’ good sheet and linen
pillow case—they were covered with dirt and torn
in many places.</p>

<p>“Next time,” said Fred, significantly, “don’t
come to a party you’re not invited to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s called for, Fred,” said his
father, quietly. “Go on back into the house and
have your fun there. If you think you’ll be likely
to rouse the neighborhood again, one of us will
stay, too; otherwise we’d like to go back and finish
our own party.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be all right,” declared Fred, hastily, and
the others echoed his assurance.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson waited till he had seen Joe Anderson
and Albert well up the street on their way
home, and then he and the other two fathers went
back to the Larue house.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Artie, as the girls and boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
found themselves in the kitchen again, “we’d better
not try any more stunts outdoors.”</p>

<p>“Huh, they won’t bother us again—you see if
they do!” said Fred, but Polly and Margy
wouldn’t hear of any more trips to the garden.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s time we had the eats,” declared
Margy, wisely.</p>

<p>She knew the boys could never resist that suggestion,
and, sure enough, as she brought out the
plates of sandwiches and doughnuts and the little
pumpkin tarts Mrs. Williamson had left for them,
no one had to be dragged to the table. There
was milk to drink, and afterward they popped
corn and buttered and ate it. They were surprised
when Mr. and Mrs. Williamson walked in
and announced that it was ten o’clock and time
for all parties to be over.</p>

<p>“I promised your mothers that you’d come
home at once,” said Mrs. Williamson, so there
was no excuse for lingering.</p>

<p>In school the next day, Albert Holmes was not
exactly pleasant—his mother had been much “put
out” because of the damage done her linen, and
Albert persisted in blaming the Riddle Club members
for this damage. Joe Anderson spread the
report that Fred had nearly broken his arm. He
allowed his listeners to infer that Fred had attacked
him, but most of the boys and girls were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
too well acquainted with Joe to believe that all the
blame could be on one side.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad when it gets real cold,” said Carrie
Pepper to her chum, Mattie Helms. “I hope
we have snow up to the windows of the houses
and tons and tons of ice.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mattie. “I like to go skating, too.
But I can’t skate very well. My ankles are
weak.”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about ice skating?” demanded
Carrie.</p>

<p>“Well, you were talking about ice,” retorted
Mattie.</p>

<p>“I was thinking about the Riddle Club,” said
Carrie. “If it will only get good and cold, they
won’t be able to have their silly old meetings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” remarked Mattie, wondering
what the weather had to do with club meetings.</p>

<p>“You would, if you’d do some thinking,” said
her chum. “When it gets too cold to meet in the
barn, where’ll they go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, around to different houses, I suppose,” answered
Mattie. “They’ll do the way we do.”</p>

<p>“Polly Marley won’t let ’em,” was Carrie’s reply
to this. “She doesn’t like going around to
different places to meet. I’ve often heard her
say so. And if they don’t meet in the barn, they
won’t meet anywhere. Then, perhaps, we’ll get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a little peace. I do get so sick,” added Carrie,
“of hearing about that old Riddle Club.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” Mattie responded. “You’d think
they had the only club in River Bend, to hear ’em
talk.”</p>

<p>The question of where they should hold their
club meetings in cold weather was also puzzling
Polly. She knew the answer to the puzzle would
have to come from her. Margy would be the
first to complain of the discomfort of the cold
barn, but the last to suggest another meeting place.
Jess was hardy and would cheerfully endure a red
nose and cold hands before she would take the
trouble to move. As for the boys, they naturally
expected Polly to think things over and work plans
out, and while they would fall in with her suggestions,
it was useless to look to them for ideas.</p>

<p>November came in cold and gray and the month
was not six days old before the citizens of River
Bend looked out one morning to find feathery
flakes floating in the air. Fathers thought of their
coal-bins and children of their sleds, but Polly’s
thoughts flew to the clubroom in the Larue barn.
A meeting of the Riddle Club was scheduled for
the next day.</p>

<p>“Gee, isn’t it cold!” cried Artie as he and Polly
started for school.</p>

<p>They met Jess and Ward and the Williamson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
twins—as usual—and the bitter cold wind that
stung their faces came straight from the river.</p>

<p>“I read where a man said this is going to be
the coldest winter we’ve ever had,” related Artie,
opening and closing his fingers rapidly in their
woolen gloves to keep the blood circulating.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s cold enough right now,” declared
Ward. “Of course, I like snow and skating, but
I’d rather have the mornings nice and warm.”</p>

<p>Fred laughed.</p>

<p>“You’d fix it up so we’d go to school with steam-heated
overcoats and shoes, wouldn’t you,
Ward?” he teased. “And then, the moment
school closed, you’d have a nice glassy hill back
right up to the door with a sled on top ready to
take you coasting.”</p>

<p>Ward admitted that he had something like that
in mind.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about, Polly?” asked
Margy, curiously. “You haven’t said a word for
the last five minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’m wondering what we are going to do about
the clubroom,” answered Polly. “To-morrow it’s
going to be as cold as ice in the barn. We haven’t
done a thing about heating it, either, except talk
about it.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t have an
oil stove,” declared Fred, positively. “That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
won’t cost much, and we can take turns filling it.”</p>

<p>“Daddy says that we can’t have any kind of a
heater in the barn,” said Jess, mournfully. “He
says the most careful children in the world could
burn a barn down without knowing they were doing
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing I see to do, then,” said
Polly, “is to wrap up extra warm. We can’t
freeze solid in an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a little cold now,” objected
Margy, “and I don’t believe Mother will want
me to stay in that cold barn. You can’t be too
careful when you have a little cold.”</p>

<p>“You say you have a cold,” declared Fred, with
brotherly frankness, “because you want an excuse
for borrowing one of Mother’s good handkerchiefs
and putting her new cologne on it.”</p>

<p>Margy looked at him reproachfully, but forebore
to argue.</p>

<p>All through the morning session Polly studied
the problem of a meeting place. That is, when
she was not reciting. She racked her mind to
think of somewhere they could go, but without
success. As Carrie Pepper had shrewdly said,
she was not willing to “meet around” at the houses
of the various members. For one thing, Polly
knew that this plan usually meant extra work and
trouble for the mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“We might not always put everything back in
place,” reasoned Polly. “And the boys are <i>so</i>
hard on chairs and furniture. They don’t mean
to be, but they can’t help it. With our own furniture,
it doesn’t matter, but just suppose Artie
should put his feet on those new satin chairs Mrs.
Larue just had sent home! And if we had anything
to eat, I’d want to run the carpet sweeper
over the rug afterward, because I just know there
would be crumbs spilled.”</p>

<p>Then she was called on to go to the blackboard,
and it was twenty minutes before she had a chance
to tackle the problem again.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, it is really trying to snow,” said
Polly to herself, glancing from the window as she
walked back to her seat. “I hoped maybe the
sun would come out and make it warmer. I
don’t see what we’re going to do with all our
lovely things, if we can’t meet in the barn any
longer.”</p>

<p>Polly meant the treasures the Riddle Club had
gathered from various sources, some by dint of
wheedling from parents who had furniture stored
in attics, some from friends made in camp, and
some—best of all—won as trophies.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about the Riddle
Club?” Carrie Pepper asked unexpectedly that
noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>She and Mattie were walking behind Polly and
Jess and Margy.</p>

<p>“Do about it?” repeated Polly, surprised.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that barn will be like an icebox now,” said
Carrie. “I was just wondering if you were going
to give up having meetings till spring. It might
not be such a bad plan—Miss Elliott said the other
day that nothing ought to be allowed to interfere
with our lessons.”</p>

<p>“The Riddle Club doesn’t interfere with our
lessons,” replied Polly, coldly. “We agreed to
stay away from meetings if our marks went below
the average. Mr. Williamson suggested that.
But we have good report cards every time—isn’t
that so, Jess?”</p>

<p>Jess nodded. Carrie always made her feel
tongue-tied.</p>

<p>“Well, our Conundrum Club is going to hold a
meeting to-morrow, at Joe Anderson’s house,”
said Carrie. “And his mother is going to give us
hot cocoa and whipped cream and cake. We
most always have something to eat in cold
weather.”</p>

<p>Margy looked at Polly as Carrie turned in at
her gate.</p>

<p>“Whatever we do, we won’t give up our club,”
said Margy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Of course we won’t,” promised Polly.</p>

<p>Artie had an important appointment with Ward
before the afternoon session of school—they each
had three cents left over from their hoard carefully
saved for the club dues, which Fred was sure
to collect the next day—and he went back before
Polly. When she reached school, five minutes before
the one o’clock bell, her eyes were bright
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Something—nice—to—tell—you,” she whispered
across the room to Margy, as the bell
clanged and the pupils took their seats. This
year, much to the three girls’ delight, Margy had
her seat in the same room as Jess and Polly,
though they did not recite together in all their
classes.</p>

<p>All that afternoon Polly fairly glowed. Her
eyes twinkled and nothing could ruffle her good nature,
not even missing a fairly easy word in spelling,
which Carrie immediately spelled after her.</p>

<p>“Get the boys,” she commanded Margy, as they
struggled into their coats in the cloakroom. “I
have the best news in the world to tell you!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A POSTPONEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Margy</span> caught Ward and Artie at the gate of
the school yard and Polly herself met Fred as he
came down the stairs, his mouth puckered to whistle
as soon as he should be safely out of the door.
Whistling inside the building was forbidden.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” cried Jess, who had
caught the excitement from Margy. “Hurry up,
Polly, and tell us.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know that room at the back of the
house we just had finished this fall?” demanded
Polly.</p>

<p>“The one your mother is going to have as another
spare room?” asked Jess.</p>

<p>“With painted furniture and a gray and pink
rug?” said Margy.</p>

<p>“Yes. Only there isn’t going to be any gray
and pink rug,” answered Polly. “Mother told
me this noon. She has talked it over with Daddy,
and she wants to wait till spring when he goes
off to the Hardware Convention. She’ll go with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
him and buy the furniture then and get the latest—she
said so. And what do you think?”</p>

<p>No one thought. They stared at the sparkling
Polly.</p>

<p>“Mother said,” Polly announced with a rush,
“that, as long as she wasn’t going to use the room,
we could have it for our clubroom this winter!”</p>

<p>“Polly! How perfectly lovely!” squealed
Margy, in delight.</p>

<p>“When did she say so?” asked Artie, this being
the first time he had heard the news.</p>

<p>“This noon, after you had gone,” Polly told
him. “And it’s the nicest room—three windows
and a window seat and as warm as toast. The
radiator is under the window seat. There isn’t a
bit of furniture in it, so we can move our own
stuff in. And it’s over the back hall, so it won’t
matter if we do make a little noise. No one will
hear us.”</p>

<p>“I said last night I wished we had a room we
could use,” declared Jess. “But our house is so
little we use every single place. In winter Dora
doesn’t go home to sleep, and that takes an extra
room.”</p>

<p>“My goodness, Jess Larue,” said Polly, “don’t
you think you’ve done enough? We’ve had that
perfectly fine room in your barn ever since the
club was started. We’ll never have as nice a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
place as that, and the minute it is warm we’ll
move back. But I certainly am glad we can have
this room.”</p>

<p>“I am, too,” declared Fred. “I say three
cheers for your mother. Do you suppose we can
meet there to-morrow afternoon, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Well, we can, if you’re willing to help move
this afternoon,” said Polly. “I think, if every
one will help, we can get everything done in time.
If there is one thing I will not stand,” she announced
firmly, “it is to meet in the room before
we get our stuff moved in. I’d rather postpone
the meeting.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” was Fred’s reply to this speech.
“What are you all standing here for? We’ve
got to move the table and the chairs and all that
junk before supper time.”</p>

<p>He started to run, and after him ran the other
members of the Riddle Club. The pavements
were wet from the stray snow flakes which had
melted as fast as they fell, and Margy slipped
once or twice, but she never complained. She,
too, felt that getting to the barn and starting the
moving was the most important thing to be considered.
At a time like this, mere legs and feet
were of little consequence.</p>

<p>They dashed into the three houses, to tell three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
mothers that they were home from school, and
then dashed out again and made for the barn.
As Ward complained, pantingly climbing the loft
ladder, they acted as though the barn was on fire
and they had to save their furniture from the
flames.</p>

<p>“Well, it gets dark so soon that we have to
hurry,” said Fred. “Hurry up and unlock the
door, Ward.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the key,” answered Ward. “It’s in
my other pocket.”</p>

<p>“You mean the pocket of your other coat,”
Artie corrected him.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that my other pocket?” argued
Ward. “How could I have the same pocket in
my other coat that I have in this one?”</p>

<p>“We don’t care about your other pocket or this
pocket or which pocket is where,” broke in Fred.
“Go get the key, Ward. And hurry. It isn’t
going to be so easy taking this stuff down that ladder
as it was to bring it up.”</p>

<p>Ward went off to get the key for the padlock,
and the others sat down in the old, dry hay to
wait for him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we lower the table out of the window?”
suggested Artie. “That’s the way they
took the new safe into the lodge hall; they pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it up to the second story on a rope. If you can
take something in that way, why can’t you take it
out?”</p>

<p>“Window’s too narrow,” Fred objected.</p>

<p>“If you can let it out of a window, what’s the
matter with lowering it over the loft on a rope?”
said Jess, slowly.</p>

<p>“We could! Good for you, Jess!” cried Fred.
“I’m not anxious to go down that ladder, let me
tell you, with one end of the table and some one
else at the other end liable to let the whole thing
slip and knock me off. Let’s get a rope and let
the table down.”</p>

<p>As Margy had once disconsolately remarked,
if there was one thing that was scarce and hard to
find in River Bend, it was a good rope. It was
her complaint that there was never anything on
hand to serve as a jumping rope, and the boys
were always discovering that they had no rope to
use when they really needed rope. Mothers
guarded their clotheslines jealously, and woe betide
the boy or girl who cut it in two, or even
chopped a tiny length off. “You’d think a
clothesline was made of gold,” to quote the exasperated
Margy.</p>

<p>“I’ll go get a rope,” offered Artie. “Dad has
some down at the store, and he said I could have
it, if I came after it. I’ll be back in a jiffy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I don’t see what Ward calls it, he is doing,”
said Jess, presently. “Even if he had to stop
to get his breath, he’s had time to find that key
and be back. Perhaps I’d better go down and see
if he needs me to help him hunt.”</p>

<p>Fred and Margy and Polly waited in the loft
till the shadows deepened to such a dark gray that
they began to think it must be nearly supper time.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you think,” said Fred.
“But I know we’ve waited long enough. I’m going
in.”</p>

<p>Margy and Polly followed him down the ladder.
To the natural shadows of a wintry afternoon,
the heavy gray snow clouds had added a
deeper tinge, and though it was only a little past
four, a light in the sewing-room of the Marley
house showed that Polly’s mother had found it
necessary to have the help of artificial light in
finishing her work.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and look at the room,” suggested
Polly, and the three went in the side door
and up the back stairs, which brought them to the
room set aside for their use.</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” commented Fred. “Just fine, Polly.
We’re mighty lucky to have it. There’s room for
everything, and that shelf will be just the place to
put the loving cup.”</p>

<p>Polly was pleased. She had been so delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to have the room to offer the Riddle Club that
she had taken their pleasure for granted; and now
Ward and Jess and Artie were apparently making
no effort to help her take possession. However,
if the critical Fred approved of the room, it must
be all right.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Mrs. Marley, passing through
the hall and seeing them sitting on the window
seat. “Why, I thought this was the big afternoon!
Where are all the others? And you
haven’t moved a thing!”</p>

<p>“Ward went to get the key and he didn’t come
back,” explained Polly, dully. “And Artie went
down to the store to get some rope, and he hasn’t
come back, either. And we waited and waited
and waited for them.”</p>

<p>“Why, Polly dear, didn’t you go after them?”
asked Mrs. Marley, in surprise. “Of course
something has happened. You mustn’t be so
ready to believe that it’s their fault. They’re just
as much interested in the Riddle Club as you are,
dear.”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not,” said Polly. “They like it
as long as I’ll do all the work and the planning,
but they won’t do a thing to help.”</p>

<p>“And this isn’t the first time Ward’s gone off
and forgotten to come back,” declared Margy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
“He always thinks there is plenty of time for
everything.”</p>

<p>“There they are now,” said Mrs. Marley, as
the doorbell sounded. “I’ll go down and send
them up.”</p>

<p>Ward and Jess came stamping up the stairs,
with Artie following them. He carried a large
coil of rope over his arm.</p>

<p>“What you doing up here?” asked Ward.
“We went up in the loft and you weren’t there.
Then we went to Williamson’s, and you weren’t
there, either.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to get anything moved, if
you don’t do anything?” said Jess.</p>

<p>“Do anything!” exploded Margy. “Where’ve
you been all this time? Here it is half-past four,
and you talk about us doing something! Where
have you been all this time?”</p>

<p>“Is it half-past four?” asked Jess. “Why,
Dora was baking cookies and we stayed to watch
her a little while. She said we could scrape the
bowl, but we didn’t wait for that. We hurried
back as fast as we could.”</p>

<p>Polly said nothing at all. Fred glanced at her
uncertainly.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Artie?” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing,” Artie replied. “I went down
to the store and got the rope; here it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Did it take you an hour?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“An hour? I wasn’t gone an hour,” Artie protested.
“All I did was to turn the emery wheel
for Mr. Kelper a little while; but it wasn’t an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Come on and let’s do the moving,” urged
Ward. “What are you waiting for? It’s almost
dark now.”</p>

<p>“It’s too dark to begin getting things down
from the loft,” said Polly, quietly. “And, anyway,
there’s no hurry; we can’t have a meeting
till after Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“Why, to-morrow!” said Jess. “It’s our day
to-morrow, Polly.”</p>

<p>“But we won’t be moved,” Polly pointed out.
“We can’t get our things in here and in place and
have a meeting, too. And if we go over our regular
day we have to wait till the next meeting. I
said I won’t hold a session without everything in
order, and I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Are you mad, Polly?” asked Jess, anxiously.
“Perhaps we didn’t hurry right back, but we meant
to.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not mad,” said Polly, calmly. “I’m
only telling you that there won’t be any meeting
to-morrow. We can move to-morrow, if you
want to.”</p>

<p>“But let’s move now, Polly,” urged Artie. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
have the rope and everything. There’s lots of
time.”</p>

<p>“We could start, Polly,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“I think Polly is exactly right,” declared
Margy. “It’s almost dark now, and we couldn’t
see to get up and down the loft ladder. Besides,
I nearly froze to death waiting up there for you.
It will serve you right to have to wait till after
Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to wait, too,” Jess retorted.</p>

<p>Polly, usually the gentlest of girls, could, when
aroused, be like “a little cake of cement,” her
father said. If she said that no meeting of the
Riddle Club was to be called till after Thanksgiving,
the other members knew that no amount of
persuasion could make her change her mind. Jess
was not exactly easy in her conscience, for she
had lingered beyond all reason; and Ward and
Artie, too, knew that they had been thoughtless
and selfish to keep the rest waiting.</p>

<p>“We’ll start to move the first thing after school
to-morrow,” said Jess. “And I’ll bring the key
with me, so we’ll be sure we have it.”</p>

<p>Fred thought wistfully of the lost dues, but he
resisted the temptation to speak of them.</p>

<small>MOVING DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As soon</span> as school was out the next day, the
Riddle Club members hurried to the Larue barn.
True to her promise, Jess produced the key and
there was no delay about getting into the clubroom.</p>

<p>“Br-rr!” shivered Margy, as the door was
opened.</p>

<p>They had not dreamed the room could be so
cold. With the window and door both closed, no
fresh air could warm the atmosphere, as it did in
the barn below where, even though there was no
heat, it usually felt several degrees warmer than
the outside temperature.</p>

<p>The threatened snowstorm had not come, but
the day was raw and cold, and each of the children
found a sweater under his or her coat most comfortable.
Margy, who perhaps felt the cold
more than any of the others, was silently thankful
that they would not have to hold another
meeting in the hayloft room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“We’d better take the table first, I think,” said
Fred. “That’s the largest piece of furniture,
and if any one gets hurt moving that, we won’t
miss him so much with the other things.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” inquired Ward, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, you know yourself that if the loving cup
fell over and sprained one of your fingers you
wouldn’t be any help in moving the table,” explained
Fred. “But if we let the table fall on
you, after it’s on the barn floor, and it breaks your
leg, there’ll still be plenty of us left to lift the
loving cup. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Apparently Ward saw, for he asked no further
questions, but helped, at Fred’s direction, tie the
rope about the table and knot it securely.</p>

<p>“Do we have to take it in the second-story window
of the house?” asked Polly, watching the
boys as they fastened the rope.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can get it up the stairs all right,” Fred
assured her. “It’s only because the loft ladder is
so rickety that we’re letting it down this way.”</p>

<p>When they came to take the table out through
the doorway, a new obstacle arose. The piece of
furniture stuck.</p>

<p>“It <i>must</i> go through,” said Fred, as though
that settled it.</p>

<p>“It came through,” declared Margy, in quite as
positive a tone. “I saw it come through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Well, it won’t go through now,” said Ward,
wiping his red face with his handkerchief. “Try
it yourself, if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>Jess giggled a little.</p>

<p>“A table couldn’t grow fat, could it?” she suggested.
“Maybe that table’s gained in weight or
something, since we moved it in.”</p>

<p>“No, I know what the trouble is,” said Polly.
“When you brought it up here, it just scraped
through the doorway—don’t you remember?
The boys had to be extra careful not to get their
fingers caught, the space was so narrow between
the frame and the table.”</p>

<p>“But it won’t even scrape through now,” Artie
objected, frowning.</p>

<p>“That’s because you have that great rope
wrapped around it,” said Polly. “It hits the
sides of the door frame. You’ll have to take it
off and push the table through.”</p>

<p>Grumbling, the boys set to work to untie the
rope. This was not easy, for Ward and Artie
had put their best efforts into those knots, and
they were fearful and wonderful to behold.
Then, too, in the pushing and shoving exerted
by the movers, the rope had twisted, so that the
knots were hard to get at. Artie finally succeeded
in unloosening one and Fred unfastened
the other, and they pulled the rope out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Now I’ll push and you two pull,” said Fred,
who would not allow the girls to help.</p>

<p>The table stuck again. Fred gave a violent
shove. Artie and Ward felt a sharp prod in their
ribs, and both went over backward.</p>

<p>“Laugh if you want to,” said the indignant
Artie, rising and looking reproachfully at the girls,
who stood behind Fred. “I don’t see anything
funny myself. It’s a wonder that we don’t go
through this fool floor.”</p>

<p>The floor of the loft was not tight, and in many
places the cracks were wide enough for a very thin
person’s foot. Some parts of the floor were
merely of poles laid closely together to hold the
hay. When Ward had been a very little boy, he
had once fallen between these poles and landed
on a pile of hay on the main floor, a much frightened
lad.</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean to laugh,” apologized Polly.
“But you looked so funny! You went down together
just like two wooden soldiers.”</p>

<p>With much pushing and pulling and some scolding
from Fred, the table was dragged to the edge
of the loft and the rope again tied around it, ready
to be lowered.</p>

<p>“What do we tie it to?” asked Fred suddenly.
“Haven’t got the confidence in your gun that you
have, Artie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Artie grinned. He had fallen over a bluff in
camp the past summer, and a rope tied to his old
gun stuck in the ground had proved to be his ladder
to safety. But even Artie could not trust his
gun to stand the weight of the table.</p>

<p>“We can hold it,” said Ward, confidently.
“The three of us can do it easily.”</p>

<p>“If the rope gets to going, it will skin our
hands,” Fred warned him.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand too near the edge, or you’ll be
dragged over,” said Polly, who was eager to help
in some way.</p>

<p>“Dump it over,” Artie advised, carelessly.
“You can’t hurt a heavy table like that.”</p>

<p>“Much you know about it,” said Fred. “One
of these legs is likely to crack off. Well, I suppose,
as Ward says, the three of us can hold it.”</p>

<p>He dragged the table nearer the edge and took
up the rope, standing back about two feet. Ward
and Artie, in the order named, took up the rope,
standing about the same distance from each
other.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the word,” said Fred, beginning
to move the table nearer and nearer, pushing cautiously
with his foot.</p>

<p>Ward felt a stinging sensation in his eye—a
grain of dust, most likely. He rubbed frantically,
while a cousin of the same mischievous dust atom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
flew on to Artie and caused him to sneeze tremendously.
As every one will tell you, it is quite
impossible to keep your mind on any job and
sneeze at the same time. Small wonder that
Artie forgot the rope, as Ward had done.</p>

<p>The table teetered a minute over the edge of
the loft, then dropped. Fred felt as though his
arms were being pulled from the sockets for one
brief moment, and then the strain slackened. He
looked back. The three girls were holding the
rope, their feet braced as they pulled. Ward
and Artie stood staring at him.</p>

<p>“Grab that rope!” shouted Fred. “What are
you thinking of? Grab hold! Do you want the
thing to go bang?”</p>

<p>Ward and Artie “came to” with a jerk and
grasped the rope. Fred continued to lower the
table gently, paying out the rope carefully, until
he felt it touch the barn floor.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said glumly. “And small
thanks to you boys. If it hadn’t been for the
girls, we would have had one smashed table.”</p>

<p>Ward and Artie were eager to make up for
their lapse, and they offered to carry the table into
the house alone.</p>

<p>“We’ll get everything downstairs first,” Fred
decreed. “Then all we’ll have to do will be to
carry the stuff in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Somebody ought to beat the rug,” said Margy.
“Mother always beats her rugs when she moves
them, even if it’s only from one room to another.”</p>

<p>No one seemed very anxious to do any rug-beating,
though Ward offered to “shake it out
of the window.”</p>

<p>“A good housekeeper doesn’t shake rugs out
of the window,” said Polly. “I’ll clean the rug
myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, housework is girls’ work, anyway,” said
Ward, placidly.</p>

<p>“I won’t clean the rug!” retorted Polly.
“Mother has a man come and beat her rugs—so
there.”</p>

<p>“The rug is clean, so stop fussing,” commanded
Fred. “We haven’t used it much. I’ll get a
broom and sweep it off and it will be all right.”</p>

<p>One by one they carried down the treasures
from their clubroom—the silver loving cup; the
six chairs; the framed sketch, made by the artist,
Miss Perry; Artie’s gun; and the radio set. This
last was to go in the Larue living-room for the
winter. It would not be needed in the clubroom,
for Artie had his own set, as did Fred. They left
the curtains, because Mrs. Marley had all her
windows curtained alike, and the new room already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
had ruffled white draperies screening the
windows above the window seat.</p>

<p>“I hope Carrie Pepper knows we have a clubroom,”
said Margy, as she helped Polly take down
the pennant tacked in place on the loft-room wall.</p>

<p>“She will know it, if she doesn’t now,” declared
Jess. “That girl hears everything, sooner or
later.”</p>

<p>They could hardly blame Carrie if she learned
about the new clubroom, for ten minutes later
Mrs. Pepper came out to feed her hens and discovered
something unusual going on in the barn.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Fred Williamson?” she
asked Fred, seeing him start, whistling, for the
Marley house, two chairs over his back.</p>

<p>“We’re moving, Mrs. Pepper,” he answered,
politely.</p>

<p>“Moving? Where to? Is Mr. Larue moving?”
asked Mrs. Pepper, forgetting to sprinkle
any more corn.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Larue isn’t moving. The Riddle
Club is,” Fred explained. “We’re going to hold
our meetings at the Marleys’ till warm weather
comes again. You ought to see the dandy room
we’re going to have!”</p>

<p>“I pity Mrs. Marley with a parcel of young ones
racketing over her house,” sighed Mrs. Pepper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
“I suppose she thinks she can keep an eye on you
better. But I wouldn’t give much for her furniture
by spring time.”</p>

<p>“We have our own furniture,” said Jess, indignantly.
She had come up with Fred in time
to hear this last remark. “We stay in our own
clubroom for meetings, and we don’t hurt a thing.”</p>

<p>“Here, chick, chick,” called Mrs. Pepper, remembering
her hungry flock. “No, I don’t suppose
you intend to do any damage. But the time
Carrie had the Conundrum Club at our house, it
took me a week to get the place to rights again;
and some of the grease spots never did come out
of the rug.”</p>

<p>Jess opened her mouth to say that the Riddle
Club didn’t spill grease on any one’s carpets, but
she thought in time that that might sound as
though she were criticizing the Conundrum Club.</p>

<p>“What a nice turkey!” she said instead.</p>

<p>“He will be nice,” admitted Mrs. Pepper,
“when I get him fattened up, if I ever do. I can’t
abide a turkey for Thanksgiving that I don’t fatten
myself. I bought this cheap, because he’s so
skinny, but I aim to have him as fat as butter by
Thanksgiving morning.”</p>

<p>Jess went on with the rug she was carrying, but
she had to stop on the side steps of the Marley
house, for the three boys were getting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
table up the stairs with much noise and some
laughter.</p>

<p>“What would they do if they had really to
move!” said Polly, joining Jess on the steps.
“And to think we’ll have to go through with this
again in the spring. Did you see Mrs. Pepper’s
turkey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she says she’s getting it fat,” responded
Jess, absently. “Say, Polly, has your mother
said anything about Thanksgiving yet?”</p>

<p>“No, she hasn’t.” Polly’s reply was prompt.
“She hasn’t said a word. And last year by this
time we knew where we were going, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Unless one of the families was going away over
the holiday or had invited relatives, it was the
custom of the Marleys, the Larues, and the Williamsons
to have Thanksgiving dinner together at
one of their homes.</p>

<p>“I think it’s kind of queer,” said Jess, soberly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE SECRET IS OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys came panting downstairs, having
landed the table in its new home safely. They
found Polly and Jess on the steps.</p>

<p>“We’re coming right up,” said Polly, hastily.
“We were just talking about Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>Margy joined them, the loving cup in her arms.</p>

<p>“What about Thanksgiving?” she asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, we were saying how queer it is we haven’t
heard yet where we’re going for dinner,” said
Polly.</p>

<p>Margy looked at her brother.</p>

<p>“Fred knows something about Thanksgiving
he won’t tell,” she complained. “I think he’s
awfully mean.”</p>

<p>“What do you know, Fred?” wheedled Polly.
“Tell us—please.”</p>

<p>Fred’s face turned a little red.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he knows a thing that we
don’t,” said Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I do, too!” cried Fred. Then he stopped.</p>

<p>“I think you might tell,” said Jess, pensively.</p>

<p>“I promised I wouldn’t. Now will you be
quiet?” said the harassed Fred.</p>

<p>“Is it about all of us? Are we in it?” asked
Margy, quickly.</p>

<p>“How could you be in a Thanksgiving dinner?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly—you know what I mean. Shall
we all know what you know when we do know?”
returned Margy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re trying to say, but
you won’t get a word out of me,” announced Fred,
firmly. “I happened to overhear some talk I
wasn’t supposed to hear, and then Dad told me
all the rest of it and made me promise not to
tell.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell just one thing?” coaxed Artie.</p>

<p>Fred had a shrewd suspicion that Artie could
find out more, if he wished, than the rest of the
children.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go asking me questions,” he ordered.
“I said I wasn’t going to tell, and that
settles it.”</p>

<p>“But, Fred, tell us just this one thing,” insisted
Artie: “When shall we know about—about it?”</p>

<p>“The week before Thanksgiving. Now I hope
you’re satisfied,” Fred retorted. “I don’t see any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
reason for standing here talking all day; if we’re
going to move, why not move?”</p>

<p>Acting on this gentle hint, they went to work
again, and before dark the new clubroom was in
apple-pie order. Very trim and clean and neat it
looked, too, and very warm and cozy it was.
Fond as they all were of the little loft room in the
barn, they could not deny that it was a bleak place
in winter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley had given the key to Polly, and
had assured her that not an outsider would be
allowed over the threshold.</p>

<p>“That means, of course,” she told her daughter,
“that you’ll have to take care of the room.
You girls will have to get together and clean it
now and then, but a room that isn’t used regularly
will stay clean a long time. You can dust it
thoroughly before each meeting.”</p>

<p>Polly loyally passed over the key to Ward, because
he had always locked the padlock on the
barn-room door. She knew he liked this duty
and felt proud to be intrusted with it.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the Riddle Club knew
they were to have news the week before Thanksgiving,
because they would have found it hard
work waiting. As it was, each time “Thanksgiving”
was mentioned in school or at home they
looked anxious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“I do think it is <i>too</i> queer,” said Jess, for the
twentieth time, as she walked home from school
with Margy and Polly. “Carrie Pepper’s mother
is going to have six aunts come to their house to
dinner. And we don’t know a thing.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, they saw Fred come dashing from
the house and give the signal that never failed to
produce Artie and Ward if they were within hearing
distance. It was a piercing whistle produced
in some mysterious manner by putting three fingers
in one’s mouth.</p>

<p>Two ear-splitting blasts answered Fred’s whistle,
and Artie and Ward shot out of the Larue
barn, where they had been engaged in some interesting
experiment. Artie always had an experiment
or two on hand.</p>

<p>“Hurry up! He wants us,” said Polly, as Fred
spied them and waved.</p>

<p>The three girls ran the rest of the way and
reached the Williamson gate breathless.</p>

<p>“You know Thanksgiving?” said Fred.</p>

<p>They nodded, dumbly.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going up to Tom’s Island!” said
Fred, who certainly did not believe in wasting
words.</p>

<p>“Tom’s Island!” echoed Polly. “But it’s winter!”</p>

<p>“All the more fun. Wait till you hear,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Fred. “We’re going up in the car Wednesday
night and stay over till Sunday. Think of the
sport! If the lake is frozen, we can skate or
walk on the ice, and maybe we can rig up a sail
and have ice boating.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have it snow,” said Artie, seriously.
“Let’s take our sleds.”</p>

<p>Margy shivered.</p>

<p>“It will be awfully cold,” she complained.
“There isn’t any heater. How’ll we keep from
freezing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll run all day and take a hot brick to
bed at night,” said the practical Jess.</p>

<p>“I think it will be great! Is that your secret,
Fred?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Fred.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, “I was back of the sofa,
hunting for my cap, when Mother and Dad came
into the parlor and began talking about it. I
heard some before I could wriggle out, and then
they told me the rest and I promised not to tell.
They wanted to get all the plans fixed before they
let us know.”</p>

<p>“And we’re all going? What a lark!” cried
Jess. “We never did that before.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all going,” said Fred. “But Mr.
and Mrs. Larue and Mr. and Mrs. Marley are
going to Rye to have dinner with Mr. Field and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
his sister and his two cousins—you know, Mr.
Kirby and Mr. Adams. Mr. Kirby planned it.
He wrote and asked us all to come, every single
one of us.”</p>

<p>“My goodness, that would have been—two—six—ten
of us; no, twelve,” said Margy, calculating
swiftly.</p>

<p>“That’s what Mother said—that twelve was
too many,” Fred replied. “So she talked it over
with the other mothers, and at first, Mother told
me, they thought they’d all go and leave us at
home. Then they decided that was kind of mean
on Thanksgiving, so Mother and Dad offered to
take us all to the island. You know Dad likes
to be outdoors. Mr. Kirby wrote and said that
plan was all right, but Dad and Mother must come
to dinner New Year’s. He asked them for
Christmas, but of course they couldn’t go away
from home on Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” echoed Polly. “So we’re going
with your father and mother in the car. I’m
so excited, I can hardly wait!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know what we’re going to do,”
said Margy, sighing as though a burden had been
taken from her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Now don’t——” Polly instructed her younger
brother, “don’t, Artie, whatever you do, tell any
one who belongs to the Conundrum Club where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
we’re going. It would be just like them to want
to go, too.”</p>

<p>Artie said he would be careful, but it was lucky
he had to memorize a verse to recite at the
Thanksgiving exercises. Artie loved to talk, and
he was apt to talk to any friendly listener.</p>

<p>It was not till the Wednesday morning before
Thanksgiving Day that Carrie Pepper heard of
the plan. School was to close at noon, and Mr.
and Mrs. Larue and Mr. and Mrs. Marley had
gone off in the Larue car at seven o’clock that
morning. Rye was over the state line and some
two hundred miles from River Bend.</p>

<p>“I saw your folks going off,” remarked Carrie,
sociably, joining the six chums as they set off for
school at half-past eight. “What are you going
to do for dinner to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“My mother’s at home,” said Margy, with dignity.
“And so is Dad.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then are they all coming to your
house?” asked Carrie. “My mother is going to
have a lot of company, too. She’s going to kill
the turkey this afternoon. He’s nice and fat,
too.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to carry the turkey with us,” said
Artie, innocently. That was enough for Carrie.</p>

<p>“Carry it with you?” she asked. “Why, where
are you going?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Up to Tom’s Island,” said Fred, darting a
severe look at Artie. “We’re going up in the
car and stay till Sunday.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of going to a summer camp in
the winter time,” declared Carrie. “You’ll probably
freeze, and it will serve you right.”</p>

<p>But the minute she reached school she told Mattie
Helms and Joe Anderson, and in less than an
hour every girl and boy in the school knew where
the Riddle Club intended to spend Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The six members hurried home as soon as
school was dismissed. They were to leave at half-past
three, and there was still some packing to be
done. Mrs. Williamson had set her heart on taking
a full Thanksgiving dinner, and there were
enough cooking utensils left at the camp, safely
packed in strong, dry boxes, to cook it properly.
The last thing Mr. Marley had ordered done before
leaving the island in the summer, was to have
Mr. Mains bring a load of firewood and stack it
under a shelter. He had foreseen that they might
wish to visit the camp in winter.</p>

<p>Each member of the club was to take a flannel
sleeping bag, a hot water bottle, a pair of blankets,
and rubber boots. Even the girls in River Bend
owned rubber boots, for they wore them to school
during the winter storms. Mr. Williamson said
they would be taken for gypsies if any one saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the back of the car, for comfortables and blankets
were piled high around the suitcases and the one
sled that Fred had insisted must go.</p>

<p>“I ought to be thankful, I suppose, that you
don’t each clamor to take a sled,” said Mr. Williamson,
good-naturedly. “No, Artie, positively
no ice skates allowed. It won’t be cold enough
for that. It may snow, but even if the lake froze
over, it wouldn’t be thick enough to bear you so
early in the season.”</p>

<p>So the skates were left out, and that gave room
enough—so Mrs. Williamson always declared—to
put the six children in.</p>

<p>Jess and Ward were upstairs, getting into their
heavy sweaters, and Mr. Williamson was backing
the heavily loaded car out of the garage, when
they heard Mrs. Pepper shrieking.</p>

<p>“Catch him! Catch him! There he goes!”
they heard her cry.</p>

<p>Then came the sharp tinkle of broken glass.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Ward, running for
the stairs and down them as fast as he could go,
Jess at his heels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper met him on the lawn. She presented
a terrifying sight, for the shawl, in which
she had muffled her head, had slipped over one ear
and gave her a reckless look. In her right hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
she carried a hatchet—a “tomahawk” the excited
Ward dubbed it—and this she waved fiercely.</p>

<p>“Where’d he go?” she demanded of the frightened
children.</p>

<p>“Where’d what go?” stammered Jess, for
Ward, as usual, had lost his breath.</p>

<p>“The turkey! I tipped the coop over—I’ve
had him shut up for a week to give him the final
fattening—and he was off like a streak. He came
in this direction. I saw him fly over the hedge.”</p>

<p>“I heard glass breaking,” said Jess, doubtfully,
turning to stare at the house.</p>

<p>Down the steps of the Marley house came Polly
and Artie, and around from behind the car in
front of their house, came Fred and Margy.</p>

<p>“Most ready?” they called. “Mother’s putting
her hat on.”</p>

<p>“One of the parlor windows is broken,” said
Jess, suddenly. “Do you suppose the turkey did
that?”</p>

<small>IN CAMP AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Ward was sure a turkey couldn’t
break a window pane and Fred and Polly and
Margy and Artie, who joined them, were doubtful,
Mrs. Pepper said that, for her part, she knew
the turkey was in the Larue house.</p>

<p>“And you’ll just have to help me get him out,”
said she. “I have company coming to-morrow
and I have to get that turkey killed and dressed
to-night. Carrie is off with some of her friends—instead
of helping me—and Mr. Pepper won’t
be home till the late boat. I’ll pay for the broken
glass, of course; but you’ll have to help me take
that turkey away.”</p>

<p>A turkey hunt promised some excitement, and
the six children went into the house determined to
find the missing bird. Mrs. Pepper implored
them not to chase him, when they found him,
“for,” she said, “I’ve been feeding him on English
walnuts and chocolates for a week, and I don’t
want him to lose his fat. A scrawny turkey is
something I can’t abide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“I feel as though I was hunting for a burglar,”
Polly whispered to Margy, as they tiptoed through
the lower rooms.</p>

<p>“So do I,” answered Margy. “Oh! What
was that?”</p>

<p>It was nothing but a window shade that had
rattled against the pane, blown by the draft which
came through the broken window. Dora, the
Larue maid, had gone to her own home to stay
over the holiday, and there was no one but the
searchers in the house.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t on the first floor,” said Fred,
when all the rooms had been carefully examined.
“Artie and I will go up to the attic and have a
look around there. A turkey might feel more
at home in an attic.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper didn’t seem convinced, but she
went on with her hunt and Fred and Artie went
to the attic. The door opening on the steep stairway
was half open, and as Fred jerked it back,
something flapped in his face.</p>

<p>Fred was no coward, but he jumped back with
a startled cry. A large turkey scuttled up the
attic stairs.</p>

<p>“He’s up here!” shouted Fred. “Come on—we’ll
get him! He’s up here!”</p>

<p>The other children came running, and Mrs.
Pepper toiled after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Don’t chase it,” she kept saying. “Don’t
chase it. You’ll run all the fat off it.”</p>

<p>“You stay down here, Ward, to head him off,”
directed Fred. “We’ll go up and get him started,
and when you hear me telling you to open the
door, you do it slowly. We only want to drive
him back to the coop.”</p>

<p>Ward seemed to understand. He took up his
station by the door which Fred closed as he followed
the rest up the attic stairs.</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Williamson whistling,” said
Ward. “I’ll bet he’s ready to go. He doesn’t
know where we are.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and tell him,” promised Mrs. Pepper.
“You stay right where you are, Ward. He’ll
wait for you when he knows you’re doing something
to help me. I couldn’t get that turkey out
of the attic alone in a month of Sundays.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper hurried off. She was short and
stout, and Ward had to admit that she would
have found turkey-chasing hard work with no
younger feet and hands to help her.</p>

<p>Ward, listening at the door, heard the sound
of quick footsteps over his head, a shout from
Fred and a burst of laughter from Artie. Then
the footsteps began to run, and Ward guessed
correctly that they were chasing the turkey over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the attic floor. Margy gave an excited shriek,
and then an avalanche seemed to be coming down
the uncarpeted stairs.</p>

<p>“Open the door!” called Fred. “Open it,
quick!”</p>

<p>Ward was so excited that he forgot to open the
door slowly. He flung it back with a jerk and an
angry and frightened turkey spread its wings and
sailed over his head, while Fred, stumbling, fell
over Artie and the two boys and Jess came down
in a heap on the protesting Ward.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” cried Polly, from the top of the
stairs. “He’s going downstairs again. Catch
him!”</p>

<p>In a moment the three boys and Jess were on
their feet, and, joined by Margy and Polly, they
rushed pell-mell down the front stairs. The door
in the hall was open and Mrs. Pepper stood talking
to Mr. Williamson on the porch. The grown-ups
caught a glimpse of a flying brown body and
then a colorful flash as six gay-colored sweaters
dashed past them. Then the chase headed for
the Pepper yard.</p>

<p>“Corn!” cried Mrs. Pepper. “Show him some
corn and he’ll walk into the chicken house.”</p>

<p>Polly dashed around to the chicken house and
caught up a measure of corn lying on a grain bin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
She ran out into the yard and shook this invitingly.
Dozens of hens gathered around her, and, sure
enough, the fugitive came, too.</p>

<p>Careful not to spill a grain, Polly walked backward
into the chicken house, and the moment the
gobbler stepped over the sill, she scattered the
corn with a lavish hand. As his long neck bent to
eat the grains, Polly slipped out and bolted the
door.</p>

<p>They were half an hour late in starting, but the
richer by an extra fruit cake Mrs. Pepper pressed
upon them.</p>

<p>The drive to Lake Bassing was made in good
time. It was a cold day, but tucked in the tonneau
with the robes, the girls and boys were warm
and comfortable.</p>

<p>Lake Bassing, in the winter, was a very different
town from the one they had known in the summer
season. Some of the houses were closed, and
there was no cheerful Dick Hare and his bus to
greet them. Mr. Williamson did not stop in
town, but drove straight to the bridge that led
to Tom’s Island.</p>

<p>“It feels like snow,” he explained, as he helped
them out, “and we want to get settled in camp
before it is pitch dark. What’s the matter,
Polly? Stiff?”</p>

<p>Polly was a little cramped and cold from sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
still so long, but as soon as she got down and
began to walk, she was all right. They all helped
to carry the things across the bridge, and then
Fred and his father ran the car down to the
Meade farm, where they were to keep it in the
farmer’s garage.</p>

<p>By the time they had walked back to the island,
Mrs. Williamson had a fire built in the kitchen
stove and one in the funny little wood stove that
had been set up in the mess-house. The girls
were spreading the blankets on the cots, and Artie
and Ward, having brought in wood, were pumping
two pails of fresh water.</p>

<p>They were all so sleepy that they decided to
tumble into bed and forego the campfire that night.
With the hot water bottles, which Mrs. Williamson
filled from the teakettle, and the sleeping bags
and blankets, they were as comfortable as could
be, when tucked in, and were asleep almost before
they had finished saying “good-night.”</p>

<p>Artie was the first to wake in the morning. He
opened one eye, glanced around, trying to remember
where he was, and then, happening to
see through the open end of the tent, he shrieked
in delight.</p>

<p>“Fred! Ward! Wake up! It snowed!” he
cried.</p>

<p>That roused the camp, and the six chums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
dressed in such haste it is doubtful if they missed
the steam heat of their bedrooms at home. The
girls came out of their tent at the same moment the
boys stepped from theirs, and a royal snowball
fight was on before breakfast.</p>

<p>“Could you consider an armistice—for flap-jacks?”
called Mr. Williamson, from the door of
the kitchen lean-to.</p>

<p>Could they? You might have thought they
had never had anything to eat since the summer
before, to see them at that breakfast table. Mrs.
Williamson insisted on baking cakes till no one
could eat a morsel more, and then the boys made
her sit down, while Polly, under her directions,
mixed more batter and baked a fresh and hot
supply for the jolly cook. The three boys took
turns carrying them in, and Mrs. Williamson said
she felt as a queen must feel with some one to
wait on her.</p>

<p>After breakfast there was the dinner to be
considered. Mrs. Williamson had done nearly
everything at home the day before, and after
more wood and water had been brought in and
Polly and Margy had set the table with a clean
cloth and the pretty favors Mr. Marley had given
them in a box before he left, the children were
told to go off and coast till they were called.</p>

<p>“I’ll ring the old cowbell as a signal,” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Williamson, pointing to an old bell that hung on
a nail in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson stayed with her, and the rest
went off with Fred’s sled to find a good coasting
hill.</p>

<p>“We can’t go off the island, or we won’t hear
the bell,” said Polly.</p>

<p>Artie was for coasting down the bluff he had
fallen over. “That,” he remarked, engagingly,
“would be even more exciting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when you landed in that cold water,
I guess you’d find it exciting,” observed Fred.
“We couldn’t pull you out with a rope, either,
because you’d drown before we could get a rope.”</p>

<p>However, it was not necessary to go over the
bluff, for they found that the gradual ascent to
it formed a hill that was steep enough to offer
good coasting. Taking turns with the sled, they
coasted to their hearts’ content, and when the
cowbell called them to dinner they brought rosy
cheeks and huge appetites to the table.</p>

<p>The turkey was the brownest, the cranberry
jelly the reddest, that they had ever seen. And
they were allowed both kinds of pie—mince and
pumpkin—because Mr. Williamson said that playing
outdoors so much would keep them from getting
ill, no matter how much dinner they ate.
Wasn’t that an understanding remark? As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Artie said, it just showed you what kind of a man
Mr. Williamson was!</p>

<p>There was a long hill back of the Meade farmhouse,
and here Mr. Williamson took them all
that afternoon. It was the kind of hill that took
your breath away, going down it on a sled, long
and steep and with a dip in the middle that made
your heart come up in your mouth, so Margy said.
The girls couldn’t help screaming each time they
went down, but they wouldn’t have stayed away
for the world.</p>

<p>When it was too dark to coast any longer, they
went back to camp and the boys built a huge bonfire.
They had cocoa, steaming hot, in their tin
cups and had turkey sandwiches and ate outdoors,
grouped around the fire “just like explorers,”
Artie said.</p>

<p>“The nicest Thanksgiving I ever had,” said
Ward, sleepily, getting into his flannel bag that
night.</p>

<p>And Artie echoed him, more sleepily still.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the snow that made Artie dream
of Christmas. At any rate, he sat up in bed the
next morning and shouted across to Fred that he
heard sleighbells.</p>

<p>“Go to sleep,” said Fred, drowsily. “You’re
dreaming.”</p>

<p>“I do, too, hear ’em!” Artie insisted. “There,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Fred Williamson! I guess you’ll believe me
now!”</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” bellowed a hearty voice, and
sleighbells crashed as the voice shouted “Whoa!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Christmas,” Fred heard Artie mutter
to himself, and that sent the older boy into fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>“You bet it isn’t Christmas,” Fred declared,
and not for anything in the world would he have
admitted that the same thought had crossed his
mind—a picture of gay and gallant Santa Claus,
clad in a jolly red suit, driving his reindeer over
the snow.</p>

<p>Ward, who didn’t mind the cold, had hopped
out of his cot and was leaping, like an antelope,
toward the tent door, his sleeping bag a decided
handicap.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Meade,” he reported, after a brief
look. “He’s got two horses harnessed to a long
bobsled—at least it looks like a bobsled. Mr.
Williamson is down talking to him. Hurry and
get dressed!”</p>

<small>ARTIE’S ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> way those boys shot into their clothes
would have been a revelation to their mothers,
who sometimes had to call them three times before
they came down to breakfast on a school
morning. In less than five minutes they were
down at the bridge and across it.</p>

<p>“Morning!” said Mr. Meade, heartily.
“Thought you’d be up. I’m going up in the woods
to cut logs, and I says to my wife, ‘If those children
haven’t been up in the woods in a deep snow,
they might like the trip.’”</p>

<p>“They haven’t had breakfast yet,” said Mr.
Williamson, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” returned Mr. Meade. “Winter
time we can wait and be neighborly, but, I declare,
in the summer I don’t have a moment to spare to
go to a wedding!”</p>

<p>He tied his horses and went back to the camp
where Mrs. Williamson and the girls had breakfast
ready. They insisted he must eat with them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and as he had had the first meal by lamp-light, he
was able to eat a second breakfast comfortably.</p>

<p>“Mother packed us a lunch, so you don’t have
to bother,” he told Mrs. Williamson, and, sure
enough, there was a large basket under the seat
of the sleigh.</p>

<p>What a trip that was—along snow-covered
roads, the sleighbells ringing and the children singing
in tune to the bells. They met few teams and
they each took turns driving the steady pair of
farm horses whose flying feet seemed to skim the
white roadway.</p>

<p>“How awfully still it is!” said Margy, when
they turned into the narrow trail that led through
the woods.</p>

<p>It was still and it was beautiful—a mantle of
spotless snow over the ground and every little
twig and bush draped in white. There were the
tracks of little wood creatures between some of
the trees, and a squirrel dived into a stump as
Fred came suddenly upon it.</p>

<p>“Are you going to chop Christmas trees?”
asked Artie, who couldn’t get away from the idea
of Christmas.</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to haul down wood to be
chopped up. That’s my main winter work,” Mr.
Meade explained.</p>

<p>The logs had been cut earlier in the year, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the sled had to be driven slowly through the
woods, stopping at each pile of timber which Mr.
Meade loaded on. Fred was allowed to drive
and very proud he felt. He had intended to have
a boat on the river when he grew up, but now he
felt that he might like to be a farmer and “get the
wood out” in the depth of winter.</p>

<p>When the sled was fairly well loaded, Mr.
Meade built a fire and they sat around it to eat
their lunch. The horses had feed-bags and ate
placidly, apparently not affected by the cold.</p>

<p>Lunch over, the fire was carefully put out, every
trace of it buried deep under the snow, and they
drove on. They stopped to get two more piles
of logs, and then drove out without turning.</p>

<p>“It’s a longer way around, but the road’s
pretty,” said Mr. Meade, who seemed to be having
as good a time as any of the children.</p>

<p>The six sat perched up on the logs—having
solemnly promised not to fall off—and pretended
they were explorers going through a new country.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it snowed in River Bend,” said
Ward.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” Mr. Meade answered. “Your
town is kind of protected, and you don’t get near
the sweep of weather we do. It’s always from
three to five degrees colder up here at the lake
than it is down with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Polly looked around suddenly at Ward.</p>

<p>“I thought Artie was sitting next to you,” she
said.</p>

<p>“He—why, he <i>was</i>!” cried Ward. “He must
have fallen off! Mr. Meade! Oh, Mr.
Meade!”</p>

<p>The farmer looked up calmly. He was sitting
down under the logs, which projected beyond
his head.</p>

<p>“Well?” he inquired pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Artie Marley!” gasped Ward. “He’s fallen
off.”</p>

<p>Mr. Meade reined in his team and stood up, his
eyes searching the road which they had just come
over. The children stood up, too, and tried to
see, but there was nothing but an unbroken expanse
of whiteness.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could fall off without saying
a word,” observed Mr. Meade. “But if he
isn’t here, he must be somewhere else. Hang on
now, because I’m going to make the turn—if I
can,” he added.</p>

<p>He tried, but the long, loaded sled wouldn’t
swing easily, and it couldn’t be backed as a wagon
could. Then, too, the farmer was afraid the load
might shift, and he couldn’t risk overturning five
children and having a pile of heavy logs fall on
top of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Can’t make it,” he said, when he had pulled
the front runners around so that the road was
blocked. “Some one will have to go back and
hunt for him. I don’t dare leave you alone with
the team, or I’d go. I think you two boys will
be the ones. Don’t go off the road, and if you
need help, shout and I’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said the anxious Polly. “Perhaps
he’s buried in a drift and can’t get out.”</p>

<p>“There are no bad drifts,” Mr. Meade assured
her. “It snowed nearly all night, but there wasn’t
any wind. I wouldn’t say there was enough snow
to even cover a boy, let alone bury him.”</p>

<p>The five children set off over the road they had
just traveled, to search for the missing Artie. It
seemed a very lonely road, now that they were
walking on it, instead of being mounted high on
a pile of wood.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Mother will say if we come
back without Artie,” worried Margy. “I must
say, Ward, I think you ought to have been watching
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Margy, Ward isn’t to blame,” protested
Polly. “Artie always takes care of himself. I
think a branch of a tree has swept him off. He’s
so thin, and if he happened to be thinking about
something else, he’d forget to hold fast, as Mr.
Meade told us to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Fred looked back. A turn in the road had already
hidden the sleigh from sight.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is hurt a bit,” said Jess
stoutly. “Artie doesn’t get hurt easily. Remember
the time he fell off the bluff?”</p>

<p>“He’s always falling off some place,” declared
Fred, gloomily. “I never saw such a boy for
mooning around when he ought to be paying attention.”</p>

<p>Artie was rather given to meditation at the
wrong time, none of them could deny that. In
school he often chose a recitation period in which
to think, and as he seldom thought about the lesson
which was being recited, he had often been
marked “zero” for questions to which he really
knew the answers.</p>

<p>“Well, we just have to find him,” said Polly.
“That’s all there is to that. A boy can’t disappear
off the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>But by the time they had tramped along for the
length of another turn, they began to think that
almost anything could happen to a boy. There
was no sign of Artie anywhere, and no trace that
might suggest what had become of him.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Fred suddenly, holding up his
hand.</p>

<p>A twig cracked under Ward’s foot and Fred
frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Do be still, can’t you?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>Jess sneezed at this point. Perhaps you’ve
noticed that when one is trying to have perfect
silence, a flood of little noises seems to be let free.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Jess, politely. “I didn’t
mean to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for pity’s sake!” cried the exasperated
Fred. “Can’t you listen a minute? I thought
I heard something.”</p>

<p>They listened intently.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Hal-lo!” came a call. “Come—back.
Come—back!”</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Meade,” said Fred. “Come on,
we have to go back.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t found Artie,” protested Polly,
ready to cry.</p>

<p>“Got to go back and see what he says,” said
Fred, firmly. “Come on. Perhaps he has found
Artie.”</p>

<p>Polly didn’t see how this could possibly be, but
she followed the rest as they turned. Fred tried
to run a little, but they had walked fast, and
Ward, especially, had no extra breath to expend,
even in a dog-trot.</p>

<p>“How could he find Artie, when he fell off back
here somewhere?” asked Jess of Polly, slipping
along the glassy depressions left by sleigh runners.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t,” Margy answered before Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
could. “I never heard of such a silly idea in my
life!” she added.</p>

<p>“All right—silly idea, is it?” said Fred.
“Then who’s that?”</p>

<p>He pointed up the road, and Polly gasped while
Ward’s mouth opened and stayed that way from
sheer surprise.</p>

<p>Coming toward them, waving his hands and
evidently most pleased to see them, was the missing
Artie!</p>

<p>“Artie Marley! where were you?” cried Polly,
while he was still two yards away.</p>

<p>“Did you think I was lost?” beamed Artie, in
reply.</p>

<p>“We didn’t think anything about it,” said Fred,
grimly. “You weren’t on that load, so we knew
you’d fallen off. But where did you tumble?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Artie, walking back with them—they
had rounded the second turn by now and
could see Mr. Meade waiting with the team. “I
didn’t fall off,” declared Artie, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Next, I suppose, you’ll say you were sitting
next to me all the time,” said Ward, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, I was down in that hole where the lunch
basket is,” explained Artie. “My feet got cold
and I climbed down there and—and I went to
sleep, I guess.”</p>

<p>And that was all the mystery of his disappearance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
He had crawled into the hole left in the
center of the wood pile, made comfortable by
heavy horse blankets, and had promptly gone to
sleep. When the sleigh stopped he had wakened
and had amazed the waiting Mr. Meade by crawling
out behind him and asking where the “other
children” were.</p>

<p>The rest of the way home Mr. Meade insisted
on turning every few miles and solemnly counting
the boys and girls to make sure there were six of
them. And when he set them down at the island
bridge, before he would let them thank him for
the happy day, he carefully counted them and
“added them to make six,” as he said. He didn’t
intend to spill any more of them out or have another
one go to sleep and be counted missing.</p>

<p>The next day the Riddle Club campers went
home, to be ready for school on Monday morning.
Ready for something else that was important, too.</p>

<p>“Our first meeting in the new clubroom,” said
Polly, happily. “Monday afternoon, as soon as
school is out! Won’t it be fun!”</p>

<small>THE RIDDLE CLUB MEETS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Polly had been so eager when she
spoke of the meeting, she was the last one to come
to the clubroom after school the next afternoon.</p>

<p>She looked flushed and excited, and, without
knowing why, the others felt a little thrill of excitement,
too.</p>

<p>Polly called the meeting to order and asked for
unfinished business. There was none.</p>

<p>“New business?” she asked.</p>

<p>Fred rose, the bank prominently displayed in
his hand.</p>

<p>“The treasurer,” he announced, rattling the
“treasure” cheerfully, “would like to remind you
that the dues are due.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for pity’s sake,” grumbled Ward. “It’s
too soon after Thanksgiving. No one has any
money this time of year.”</p>

<p>Fred gave him an exasperated glance.</p>

<p>“I only wish,” he said coldly, “that you’d let
me know the time of year you want to pay your
dues. In summer you say you need the money for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
ice-cream and in winter you need it for—for—icicles,
I suppose!”</p>

<p>Ward giggled and Margy sighed.</p>

<p>“Now they’ll argue over that for half an hour,”
she whispered to Polly.</p>

<p>But Fred was in no mood for argument. He
felt that he had a duty to perform and he intended
to perform it, whether or not his friends enjoyed
the performance.</p>

<p>“If you think I enjoy prying you loose from
ten cents, Ward Larue,” said Fred, “or you either,
Artie Marley, you’re mistaken. But as long as
we have a club and a treasurer and I’m the treasurer,
you’re going to pay your dues and pay ’em
at the right time.”</p>

<p>“I guess you can’t collect the money if I haven’t
got it,” retorted Ward.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll lose your standing,” said Fred,
making a wild guess at the “by-laws.” The Riddle
Club had never bothered much with by-laws.</p>

<p>But Polly thought it time to interfere.</p>

<p>“I think you boys are too silly for words,” she
pronounced. “Of course Fred has to collect the
dues—that’s his work. But you know, Fred, that
if you didn’t pitch into Ward, he’d hand you the
ten cents without coaxing. Why you want to
argue and get cross is more than I can understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Ward scowled and Fred laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“There’s the bank,” he said. “You can put
your money in it or leave it alone. But let me tell
you, no club lasts very long without dues.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t spent a cent yet,” grumbled Ward,
but he slipped his dime into the bank in something
like haste.</p>

<p>The other dimes tinkled merrily after, and the
sound was music in Fred’s ears. Whatever he
chose to do, he did with all his might, and the
matter of club dues was a serious matter with him.</p>

<p>“What are we going to spend the money for?”
asked Artie, to whom, like Ward, the bank seemed
to hold a fortune.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to spend it for anything,”
Polly informed him, “till we need something very
much.”</p>

<p>“We could buy Christmas presents with it,”
suggested Artie, wistfully.</p>

<p>“Artie Marley, I’m surprised!” said Polly.
“That money doesn’t belong to us any more. It
is club money, and has to be spent for the good of
the club. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad,” remarked Artie, “that the
dues aren’t more than ten cents.”</p>

<p>Fred was ready with a retort, but Polly forestalled
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Is there any other business before the club?”
she asked quickly.</p>

<p>Apparently there was not.</p>

<p>“Let’s begin and ask riddles, then,” said Margy.</p>

<p>“I have something to tell, first,” announced
Polly. “Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>From her blouse pocket she took six tiny boxes,
each wrapped in white paper and fastened with an
elastic band.</p>

<p>“What in the world——” began Margy, but
Jess said:</p>

<p>“Sh!”</p>

<p>“There’s one apiece,” said Polly, her voice
trembling a little with eagerness. “Your names
are written on the boxes. Here, Margy.”</p>

<p>She handed Margy one of the boxes and, in
rapid succession, Jess, Fred, Ward and Artie received
theirs. One was left for Polly.</p>

<p>“Do we open them?” asked Jess, and at Polly’s
nod six pairs of hands went to work.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Artie simply, when he had opened
his box.</p>

<p>The contents were the same. In each box, on
a bed of pink cotton, lay a shining pin. Dark
blue enamel with a tiny “question mark” inlaid in
gold. Margy turned hers over. On the back
“Margy Williamson” was engraved.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p116.jpg" alt="YOU ARE GOING TO PAY YOUR DUES"></div>
<p class="caption">“YOU ARE GOING TO PAY YOUR DUES.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“And our names on the back!” said Jess, in a
tone of awe, turning her pin over.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Kirby send them?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“He gave them to Mother to bring back with
her,” explained Polly. “Aren’t they lovely? I
never saw such a darling pin!”</p>

<p>“And there isn’t another like it, anywhere!”
murmured Margy. “We can wear them to school
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t we have to thank Mr. Kirby, or something?”
asked Artie, seriously, and though they
laughed at him, they knew what he meant.</p>

<p>“I can write a letter,” said Polly, “and we’ll all
sign it.”</p>

<p>And a day or two later a “round robin” letter
went to Rye, signed by each member of the Riddle
Club, a letter that left no doubt in Mr. Kirby’s
mind as to the pleasure his pins had given the
lucky boys and girls who received them.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Polly, when the pins were fastened
in a conspicuous place on each blouse or coat,
“we can have our riddles.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a riddle for Fred,” announced Ward:
“How much money does the moon represent?”</p>

<p>“Huh, that’s easy,” retorted Fred, confidently.
“Quarters, of course.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t how much,” said Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Well, give me time to think and I’ll tell you,”
answered Fred. “The moon has four quarters—and
four quarters—four quarters make a dollar.
Ah-ha, Mr. Larue, the moon represents a dollar.”</p>

<p>Ward was divided between admiration for
Fred’s mathematical abilities and chagrin that he
had solved the riddle. The former won.</p>

<p>“You did get it,” he said generously. “You
certainly are good at guessing riddles, Fred.”</p>

<p>Fred was determined to show that he could be
generous, too.</p>

<p>“I took two guesses,” he said, “and that really
isn’t fair. I think only one guess should be allowed.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” decided Polly. “If each one
takes two or three guesses, we use up the afternoon
arguing.”</p>

<p>Artie’s easy giggle hinted that he rather enjoyed
the argument, but Margy and Jess were
loudly in favor of the single guess.</p>

<p>“Your turn now, Margy,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“Why is your nose in the middle of your face,
Ward?” asked Margy, with startling suddenness.</p>

<p>Ward had been day-dreaming, and the question
caught him unprepared. For the moment he forgot
that they were solving riddles.</p>

<p>“Where else would my nose be?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“That’s a riddle,” Margy explained, laughing.
“Why is your nose in the center of your face?”</p>

<p>Polly choked and turned it into a cough.</p>

<p>Ward felt of his nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s in the middle of your face,” said Margy,
hastily. “Why?”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to keep telling me,” Ward announced,
with dignity. “I heard you. My nose
is in the middle of my face because—because a
nose knows where it ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“I told you the answer myself, and Polly nearly
gave it away by laughing,” said Margy. “The
reason your nose is in the middle of your face,
Ward, is because it is the scenter.”</p>

<p>“The center of what?” asked the suspicious
Ward.</p>

<p>“The center is the middle—that’s one kind,”
said Margy, patiently. “And then it’s the scenter—your
nose is—because you use it to smell with.”</p>

<p>Ward considered this in silence for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” he admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>“There’s no maybe about it,” said Margy.
“Are you going to pay a forfeit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Ward.</p>

<p>“Then I’d like three of the stuffed dates you
have in your pocket,” announced Margy, calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Your nose is a good scenter,” Fred told her.
“How did you know Ward had stuffed dates with
him?”</p>

<p>“Because I saw him eating one,” said the calm
Margy.</p>

<p>Ward had the grace to blush a little, and, jerking
the box from a pocket already stuffed to the
bursting point, he silently passed it to Margy.
She opened it, took out three dates and gave it
back to him.</p>

<p>“One apiece,” she said, handing a date to Polly,
another to Jess, and popping the third into her
own mouth.</p>

<p>There were three dates left, by good luck, and
Ward distributed these to Artie and Fred and
peace reigned again.</p>

<p>“Your turn, Artie,” said Polly, who wanted to
laugh, but decided that Margy didn’t.</p>

<p>“Mine’s about a nose, too,” said Artie. “Jess,
what have noses but smell not?”</p>

<p>“Teapots,” said Jess, with a beaming smile.</p>

<p>Artie looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“Bet you can’t guess this, Polly,” said Fred:
“What is that which we often return but never
borrow?”</p>

<p>“Why, Fred Williamson, that’s my own pet
riddle,” protested Polly. “I was saving it up
to ask you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“What don’t you borrow?” asked Jess, curiously.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“What for? I didn’t do anything,” replied
Jess, bewildered.</p>

<p>“That’s the answer to the riddle,” said Polly,
merrily.</p>

<p>“I want to ask Margy a riddle,” Jess said.
“What word will, if you take away the first letter,
make you sick?”</p>

<p>“You always pick out riddles with arithmetic
in them,” Margy complained. “And I can’t spell
long words, either.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t a long word,” Jess encouraged her.
“It’s a short one.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Polly, rising. “Some
one is knocking on the door.”</p>

<p>“Is it mince pie?” asked Margy, in a desperate
effort to give the answer before she should be interrupted.
“Is it mince pie, Jess?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is not!” said Jess, and at that moment
Polly flung the door open and visitors appeared
on the threshold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>FRED WILLIAMSON, BANKER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Marley</span>, Mrs. Larue and Mrs. Williamson
stood in the doorway. It was Mrs. Marley
who asked:</p>

<p>“May we come in?”</p>

<p>Fred and Artie brought chairs and Ward scrambled
over on the window seat, leaving his place
vacant.</p>

<p>“We thought the meeting would be over,” said
Mrs. Marley. “And we wanted to see how you
looked in your new quarters. But don’t let us interrupt.
I don’t believe you’ve adjourned.”</p>

<p>“We have only a couple more riddles to ask,”
said Polly. “That won’t take long.”</p>

<p>“The meeting would have been over,” Margy
explained, “only it took Fred so long to argue
about the dues.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley laughed and glanced at the other
two mothers.</p>

<p>“My sympathy is with Fred,” Mrs. Larue declared.
“I’ve been treasurer, Fred, and I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
what it is to have to send bills out three times for
one collection. If I had to go and ask verbally
for the money—well, I don’t believe there would
be much money collected in our organization.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we always pay our dues,” said Ward,
easily.</p>

<p>“Yes, you pay ’em—after I’ve made myself
hoarse asking you,” Fred exploded.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I think we’d better go on with the
meeting,” said Polly, wishing that Margy had
never mentioned the subject of dues.</p>

<p>“All right—I’m ready,” announced Jess. “I
asked Margy a riddle: ‘What word will, if you
take away the first letter, make you sick?’ But
Margy used up her first guess—she thought it was
mince pie.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t really think it was mince pie,” explained
Margy, carefully. “I just said that because
I was in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Then do you want another guess?” asked
Polly. “She may have another one, Jess, the
knocking at the door <i>did</i> hurry her.”</p>

<p>Jess was willing, so Margy tried again.</p>

<p>“If I could spell, I wouldn’t mind,” said Margy,
after thinking deeply for a moment. “Is the
word pill?”</p>

<p>Most of the Riddle Club members thought
Margy had guessed it. Polly knew the answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
but the boys were sure Margy had the right word.
They were surprised to see Jess shake her head.</p>

<p>“But if you’re ill you’re sick,” Margy argued.
“Why isn’t that right, Jess?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Jess, “the word is music.
Take away the first letter, and you have U-sick.
Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I call that a foolish riddle,” sighed
poor Margy. “But I’ll pay a forfeit. What
shall it be, Jess?”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to pay much of a forfeit,” Jess
assured her. “You almost had the riddle, so I’ll
give you an easy one to pay—nothing to redeem.
The red beads, please.”</p>

<p>Margy and Polly laughed. The string of red
beads Margy was wearing belonged to Jess, and
she was merely taking her own property as a forfeit.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll ask Artie,” Polly said, when the
beads had changed hands. “Then we can adjourn
the meeting.”</p>

<p>“Artie,” she said quickly, “on what side of the
pitcher is the handle?”</p>

<p>Artie sat in perfect silence for what seemed a
long time. No one moved, so fearful were they
of disturbing his train of thought. It must have
been three minutes—and a long three minutes it
was—before he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“The outside,” said Artie, sweetly.</p>

<p>He looked around, and his irrepressible grin
broke out. In a minute Ward was on top of him,
and they were rolling joyously about on the window
seat.</p>

<p>“You knew it all the time!” Ward accused his
chum. “You sat there like a chump, just pretending.”</p>

<p>Artie did not deny the charge. His twinkling
blue eyes spoke for him and he was distinctly
pleased with his joke that had kept a roomful of
people silent for three minutes or so.</p>

<p>“Sit up and behave,” President Polly commanded
sternly. “Is there any other riddle to be
asked? No? Some one make the motion to adjourn.”</p>

<p>Fred made the motion, Jess seconded it, and the
meeting was over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williamson looked smilingly at Polly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should have spoken of this before
your meeting was over,” she said. “But to tell
you the truth, I’ve only just now remembered it.
Mr. Williamson would like to offer another riddle
with a prize for the answer.”</p>

<p>The Riddle Club had had these prize riddles before.
It was always fun to try to get the answer,
and the prize was always worth while.</p>

<p>“If you’ll write it down, Polly,” suggested Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Williamson, “I’ll give it to you now. The answers
are to be read at your next regular meeting
and the prize will be five dollars.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley whispered to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I forgot to say that the prize is to
go to the Riddle Club bank—not to an individual,”
said Mrs. Williamson.</p>

<p>Fred rattled the bank and its contents in delight.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he said, in heart-felt delight, “that’s
great!”</p>

<p>To be sure, the prizes the various children had
won before this had always gone into the Riddle
Club bank, but this was the first time the prize had
been offered directly for the bank.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good that money is going to
do us,” said Ward now. “Fred will never let us
spend a cent.”</p>

<p>“If we’d spent it every time you wanted to,
there wouldn’t be a cent left in there to-day,” declared
Fred, with truth on his side.</p>

<p>“Don’t bicker,” Mrs. Marley warned them.
“Better take down the riddle, Polly. And whatever
you do, don’t argue over the five dollars before
it is won; none of you may be able to guess
Mr. Williamson’s puzzle.”</p>

<p>Polly took her pencil and paper and Mrs. Williamson
pulled a little book from her knitting bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“This is the riddle, Polly,” she said. “Stop
me, if I read too fast.”</p>

<p>Then slowly and carefully, she read aloud,
while Polly wrote it down:</p>

<p>“Why do pianos bear the noblest characters?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Polly. “I have that.”</p>

<p>“That’s the entire riddle,” Mrs. Williamson
answered. “There is no more.”</p>

<p>The members of the Riddle Club stared. The
other prize riddles had been complicated ones,
some rhymed, all contained more words. This
sounded so simple that it must be a mistake.</p>

<p>“But that’s such an easy riddle!” said Ward,
unguardedly. “Most any one can guess that.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Ward,” Mrs. Williamson encouraged
him. “Guess it and win the five dollars for
the club.”</p>

<p>“Pianos bear the noblest characters,” recited
Ward, with confidence, “because—because—because—well,
of course, I’d have to think about it,”
he ended lamely. “But I don’t believe it’s hard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Williamson laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the answer myself,” she told
them, “but I do know Mr. Williamson. And
something tells me he hasn’t chosen a very easy
riddle for you to guess. However, you may succeed
in surprising him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Then Mrs. Larue said she had something to
tell.</p>

<p>“I’ve been admiring your lovely clubroom ever
since I came in,” she said pleasantly, “and I can’t
see that you need a single thing more than you
have. But before I came away this afternoon,
Mr. Larue gave me a silver dollar to spend as his
contribution for the club. He thought I would
put another dollar with it and buy something nice
for your clubroom.”</p>

<p>“And I have two silver dollars I was commissioned
to spend in the same way,” added Mrs.
Williamson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley said she had the same amount in
her purse.</p>

<p>“Of course, we wouldn’t dream of buying without
first coming to see your clubroom,” she told the
children; “and now we’ve seen it, the problem is
worse than ever. You really have as much furniture
as would be comfortable, and your decorations
mean far more than any you could buy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be a good plan,”
asked Mrs. Larue, gently, “to put the six dollars
in the bank, along with the club dues? Then, any
time you wished to spend it, it would be waiting
for you.”</p>

<p>The Riddle Club accepted this plan with enthusiasm.
They were even able to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
something of Fred’s pride in the bank as the six
shining round silver dollars slipped into the slip at
the side and rang merrily against the other coins.</p>

<p>“We’re really getting wealthy,” said Margy,
soberly.</p>

<p>Fred was so proud of the bank and the money
in it that he was reluctant to leave it long enough
to go downstairs at Mrs. Marley’s invitation,
where hot chocolate and little sweet cakes were
awaiting them as Mrs. Marley’s treat.</p>

<p>“Don’t lock the door, Ward,” Fred said, as
they went downstairs. “I’ll come back and get
the bank.”</p>

<p>Fred kept the bank in his own room, and usually
he buried it under a pile of magazines in his clothes
closet.</p>

<p>Margy’s seat in the dining-room was near the
window, and, happening to glance out, she saw
something that made her forget even the cake
with the walnut in the center, which she had coveted
when they first sat down.</p>

<p>“It’s snowing!” she cried. “Look—real
snow!”</p>

<p>It really was snowing. River Bend had not
had the snowstorm which covered Lake Bassing
with a white blanket over Thanksgiving Day, and
their schoolmates had listened enviously when
they heard of the fun the Riddle Club had had in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
camp. The snow now falling was the first of the
winter for the little town.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose winter has really set in,”
sighed Mrs. Marley. “You children will be glad
to see the snow, but I don’t care for it as much
as I did when I was your age.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will snow all night,” declared Fred.
“We haven’t had any coasting in an age.”</p>

<p>But the prospect of coasting to-morrow did not
interfere with his enjoyment of a second cup of the
chocolate and another cake when Mrs. Marley
insisted that he have more.</p>

<p>After the cakes had disappeared, Fred went
back to get his bank, and then, as it was too dark—so
the mothers said—to go out and play in the
snow, which by now covered the pavements and
lawns with a thin, white covering, the Larues and
the Williamsons went home.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson was reading before the living-room
fire, and Fred went in to tell him about the
club meeting and to thank him for the prize riddle
offer and the silver dollar he had sent the club
fund.</p>

<p>“By the way, Fred,” Mr. Williamson said presently,
“wouldn’t you rather open an account in the
bank in the name of the Riddle Club? That iron
bank of yours must be heavy to carry around, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
besides you have too much money in it now to allow
yourself to be careless.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to take care of it, Daddy,” was
Fred’s answer. “Nothing will happen to it; I’m
not careless.”</p>

<p>“Fred, I just found your bank on the hall
table,” said his mother, coming into the room.
“That isn’t the place to leave it.”</p>

<p>Fred looked a little confused.</p>

<p>“I was on my way upstairs, Mother,” he said,
with dignity. “I stopped to speak to Daddy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ON POND’S HILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> took his bank upstairs and hid it in the
usual place. That night he dreamed he was president
of a bank and the members of the Riddle
Club came to him to pay their dues faster than he
could take the money in. There seemed to be a
great many more members than six, and presently
Fred discovered the reason—the Conundrum Club
members had joined!</p>

<p>The shock of this discovery woke him up. It
was morning, but so gray and dull that Fred was
ready to turn over and go to sleep. Then he remembered
that it had begun to snow the night before
and he hopped out of bed and pattered to the
window. It was still snowing and everything in
sight was well covered.</p>

<p>Of course there was no sleep for Fred after
that, and not much for the rest of the Williamson
family. Usually Fred waited till his father
called him before he started to dress, but this
morning he was downstairs and prancing about on
the porch when his father came to look for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Here, here, can’t you wait till after breakfast?”
asked Mr. Williamson. “Mother is going
to bake hot cakes, and the boy who appears with
his hair combed and his necktie straight is going
to have the first one.”</p>

<p>Fred dashed back to his room and hastily
brushed his hair. He and Margy felt a deep interest
in hot cakes, but it must be confessed they
were also “crazy” about the snow. They could
hardly wait to eat their breakfast, bundle themselves
into coats and hats and woolly scarfs, and
plunge into that beautiful whiteness.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called Artie, from his porch, as he
saw the Williamsons about to start for school.
“Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>The Marley front steps had not been brushed
off, and Artie had no idea of the depth of the
snow. He took one step and sank into a feathery,
fluffy bed up to his neck.</p>

<p>“Gee, I missed that next step,” he said, with
perfect good humor, rising and brushing himself
off. “Here comes Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly and the Larues joined the others, and,
running and laughing, they began the walk to
school. The flying flakes stung their eyes and
melted on their faces, and it was fun to make
snowballs and hurl them at the fences and trees
they passed and, yes, at each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“We’ll go coasting this afternoon, sure,” said
Fred, as they reached the school-yard gate.</p>

<p>Home they raced at the close of the afternoon
session to get out the sleds hidden in attic and cellar
since the winter before.</p>

<p>The boys had each a sled, and Polly and Jess
had their own, but Margy preferred to claim a
share in Fred’s long racer. She could never be
induced to go down the hill alone, and most of the
time she coasted with Polly.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s here,” said Ward, cheerfully,
when they reached Pond’s Hill, a beautiful slope
on the other side of town.</p>

<p>It was still snowing fitfully, but the flakes were
larger, an indication that the storm was beginning
to let up. Artie and Ward wished it would snow
for a week, but the older folk thought that a day
and a night should satisfy any one.</p>

<p>“There’s Carrie Pepper,” whispered Polly to
Margy.</p>

<p>“And Mattie Helms,” added Jess.</p>

<p>“And Joe Anderson,” said Artie. “He has a
new sled.”</p>

<p>Fred heard and turned to look. Sure enough,
Joe had a new sled and it was a beauty, long and
low and with the flexible steering gear of the best
make of sled. Harry Worden, a post-graduate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
student in the high school, was examining Joe’s
possession in evident admiration.</p>

<p>“Some sled!” was his verdict.</p>

<p>Then he saw Fred and waved to him. The
Riddle Club members knew Harry Worden very
well. The spring before, when he was a high
school senior, he had served as referee at a riddle
contest held between their club and the Conundrum
Club. They liked him very much.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fred,” called Harry. “Come on over
here and look at this.”</p>

<p>Fred went over to the other side of the road,
glad of a chance to see the new sled more closely.</p>

<p>“It’s a peach!” he told Joe, heartily. “Present?”</p>

<p>“Got it for my birthday,” Joe answered. “This
sled cost a lot, and it’s better than any one else’s.
I’ll bet I can beat any one on the hill now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of that,” drawled
Harry Worden, lazily. “It isn’t always the sled
that wins a race. Something depends on the boy
who does the steering.”</p>

<p>“Bet you I can beat any one on the hill,” Joe
boasted.</p>

<p>Harry only laughed and turned away and Fred
went back to his friends.</p>

<p>“Take Margy down first, Fred,” Polly suggested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
“She has more fun before her feet get
cold.”</p>

<p>Margy was apt to complain, midway in her outdoor
sport, that her feet were “freezing.”</p>

<p>Fred obligingly took his sister on behind him,
but neither one could be said to enjoy the ride
down the hill. Margy shut her eyes tight and
Fred declared she pinched him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” said the indignant Margy. “I had
to hang on to something, didn’t I? Anyway, Fred
Williamson, you go too fast.”</p>

<p>Polly said Margy should coast with her next,
and amicable relations were restored, as Fred
shot down the hill alone, deftly curving in and
out to avoid the sleds that were flying down at
the same time.</p>

<p>“I wish I could steer as well as Fred can,”
sighed Polly, taking her place on her own sled with
Margy back of her. “It’s because he isn’t afraid
to take a chance. He will go around a sled or
almost into the ditch. But I’m always thinking of
a smash-up.”</p>

<p>Ward and Artie were enjoying themselves in
their own way, which was a peculiar one, to say
the least. Ward liked to lie flat on his sled with
Artie perched on top of him, and if one or the
other rolled off in the course of the descent, why,
that was nothing at all! Snow, argued Ward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Artie, was soft and comfortable, and one could
always get out of the way of an approaching sled
by tumbling over and over till safe from the danger
of being run down.</p>

<p>Jess, too, had a method, and she followed it
faithfully. Hers was a sober enjoyment, for she
went down the hill on her sled, turned around and
trudged back, to do the same thing again. Left
alone, Jess would coast contentedly a whole morning
or afternoon, without mishap or apparent excitement.</p>

<p>Polly and Fred liked to try experiments. They
tried Polly’s sled with Fred steering, and Fred’s
sled with Polly guiding it. They went down
backward once and landed in the ditch. They
tried to see how many children they could pile on
the two sleds, and they raced each other with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was when they were returning from one of
these races that Harry Worden hailed them.</p>

<p>“Hey, Fred, want some fun?” he shouted.</p>

<p>Fred did, and he and Polly ran over to where
Harry stood.</p>

<p>“Joe Anderson wants a race,” said Harry.
“He thinks your sled is probably the fastest on
the hill, next to his. Want to try a race?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Fred, quickly. “I’m willing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The news of the proposed race spread in a moment,
and a crowd of boys and girls gathered
around Fred and Joe.</p>

<p>“Go to it, Fred,” some cried. “You can win.”</p>

<p>“Joe has the best sled,” others insisted. “No
one can win against that flier. It’s a peach.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know—Fred can get a lot of speed
out of his old boat,” said one of the boys.</p>

<p>Albert Holmes sniffed.</p>

<p>“Old boat, is right,” he said. “It’s about fifty
years old.”</p>

<p>Fred grinned good-naturedly. His sled wasn’t
new, but it wasn’t falling apart yet, he assured
them.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to the foot of the hill to watch
the finish,” announced Harry Worden. “Billy
Pierce will give you the word to start.”</p>

<p>Jess and Artie and Ward decided to stay at the
top of the hill, but Polly tagged along after
Harry, and Margy went with her. As soon as
they reached the foot of the hill, Harry waved his
arm as a signal to Billy Pierce to give the word to
the racers.</p>

<p>“There they go!” cried Polly, as the two black
specks at the top of the hill suddenly shot down.</p>

<p>The snow had stopped half an hour before, and
the hill was well packed from the sleds and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
feet of the coasters. It was cold, but even Margy
forgot that in the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>The sleds seemed to be evenly matched half of
the distance, then one pulled slightly ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s Fred!” said Polly, in a half-whisper. “I
know him by his cap.”</p>

<p>Fred’s sled, if it was Fred’s sled, kept the lead.
The other did not gain.</p>

<p>“Fred shot around that well in the road, I
guess, and Joe must have gone in and out—that
takes time,” said Harry. “But you’re likely to
land in the ditch, going around.”</p>

<p>The watchers could see now that it was Fred
who was ahead. Margy thought she felt a flake
of snow and looked up at the sky, while Harry
allowed his gaze to wander past the racing sleds
to the top of the hill. It was but a moment, but
Polly was the only one to see what happened in
that moment.</p>

<p>“He turned him!” she cried. “I saw him do
it! That Joe Anderson would do anything to
win! Don’t let him, Harry. Please, don’t let
him!”</p>

<p>Harry Worden looked at the sleds, now near
enough to be plainly distinguished. Joe Anderson
was in the lead, grinning triumphantly, and Fred
was just swinging his sled back on the course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Told you I could do it!” said Joe, as his sled
swept past Polly and Margy and Harry. “Can’t
beat this sled!”</p>

<p>“You cheated!” Polly accused him, almost beside
herself with anger. “I saw you! You put
out your hand and shoved Fred over to the left.
That isn’t fair, and don’t you dare——”</p>

<p>Fred tumbled off his sled and came up to them.
He looked angry, but when he saw Polly he tried
to grin.</p>

<p>“I won!” said Joe Anderson, boastfully. “You
did pretty well, Fred. But of course your steering
gear is out of date.”</p>

<p>“You cheated!” said Polly again.</p>

<p>Harry Worden looked troubled.</p>

<p>“Of course, I wasn’t looking,” he said slowly,
“and I didn’t see what happened. But Polly
seems to think——”</p>

<p>Fred turned to Polly and blazed at her, to her
utmost astonishment, for he had never spoken to
her like that in his life.</p>

<p>“You keep still!” he cried angrily. “I lost the
race, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t all there is to it,” Harry Worden
corrected him. “You race again, and this time
I intend to know what is going on.”</p>

<small>DETECTIVE MARGY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I promised</span> my mother I’d go home at half-past
four,” said Joe, uneasily.</p>

<p>“You can stay another ten or fifteen minutes,”
Harry informed him. “You go back and tell
Billy Pierce I say this race is to be done over.
Tell him there’s no decision.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him you wouldn’t give a decision,” said
Joe, hotly. “I won, and you’re afraid to say so,
just because Polly Marley——”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much doubt about your cheating,
Joe,” said Harry, as coolly as he usually spoke.
“But as I didn’t see what happened with my own
eyes, I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt.
You’re lucky, if you’d only see it the right way.”</p>

<p>Joe turned sullenly away and began to plod
up the hill, dragging his sled after him. At the
top of the hill Billy Pierce held the eager coasters
back, for he could see that some sort of argument
was taking place below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Just a minute, Fred,” said Harry, as Fred
turned to go back. “Are you willing to race
again?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Fred, looking everywhere but at
Harry or Polly.</p>

<p>“Were you knocked off the road?” asked
Harry, a little hesitantly.</p>

<p>“I lost the race, and that’s all there is to it,”
said Fred, doggedly.</p>

<p>“All right, go on,” Harry dismissed him.</p>

<p>“Joe put out his hand and gave him a big push,”
said Polly, watching Fred as he trudged up the
hill. “If I was Fred I’d tell him what a cheat he
is. I never could stand that Joe Anderson.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see him do anything,” declared
Margy, mildly.</p>

<p>“You never do see anything,” retorted Polly,
for, gentle as she was, any unfairness always
roused her, and once “woke up,” as Jess called it,
she was not easily soothed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we were asleep at the switch,
Margy,” said Harry Worden ruefully. “This
time I mean to glue my eyes on the road and keep
them there.”</p>

<p>“But Fred must know he cheated,” argued
Polly.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Fred’s idea of a good loser is
one who doesn’t grunt,” Harry tried to explain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
“He’d rather say nothing than be thought complaining
because he failed to win.”</p>

<p>Polly was not convinced, but she said nothing
more. And she and Harry and Margy stared at
the white road till their eyes ached, waiting for
the two black specks to come toward them.</p>

<p>It was a long hill, and when the boys reached
the top there were explanations to be made to
Billy Pierce and the curious boys and girls who
wanted to know what had happened. Seated at
last on their sleds, Joe made a start before the
signal was given and had to be brought back.
The next time he sulked and did not start at all,
and it was Fred who had to turn around.</p>

<p>At last, though, they got off, and those at the
foot of the hill saw the two dots swooping downward.
There was one bad spot in the road—the
depression Harry had mentioned—and Fred
grimly swung his sled around, grazing the deep
ditch and even trembling a fraction of a second
on the edge before he threw his weight to the
right and shot back to the center of the road.</p>

<p>Joe had decided to take the hole, changed his
mind too late, and went into it sideways as a result
of his effort to swing to the left as Fred had
done. He almost upset his sled, but righted it in
time and was out of the hole a half yard behind
the flying Fred. As the boys had discovered, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
was Fred’s quick judgment and willingness to
“take a chance” that gave him the advantage.
He had strong wrists, too, and could change his
course as easily as Joe could change his mind.</p>

<p>That was Joe’s great drawback—this habit of
changing his mind. It interfered seriously with
his steering, for if there is one place where it is
not wise to change your mind, it is on a steep hill.
Having once decided on his course, the wise
coaster sticks to it. Joe’s indecision was reflected
in the wobbly movements of his sled, and this time
he came in a yard behind Fred.</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” said Harry, with relief.
“You win, Fred.”</p>

<p>“I won the other—only you wouldn’t play
fair,” said Joe, hardily.</p>

<p>“It’s getting dark, but there’s still time for another
race if you want to call it a tie,” declared
Harry, swiftly. “Is it a tie, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let Fred have it—I don’t care,” Joe mumbled.</p>

<p>“I’ll race again,” said Fred, after a moment’s
silence.</p>

<p>“No, the others are coasting now,” decided
Harry. “We can’t hold them up any longer, for
it’s getting dark. Fred wins, and if I were you,
Joe, I wouldn’t go around making any uncalled-for
remarks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Joe took his sled and went back without a word.
Harry Worden followed him to make sure that a
truthful report was spread around, and Polly and
Fred ploughed slowly up the road, at one side,
pulling Margy on Fred’s sled.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to snap at you, Polly,” said
Fred, a little shyly. “I guess I sounded pretty
cranky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” declared Polly, determined
not to let him know he had hurt her feelings.
“I didn’t mind that, Fred. But I saw Joe
Anderson push you—I certainly did.”</p>

<p>“Well, you want to forget that and forget it
for good,” said Fred, stopping in the snow and
speaking very earnestly. “I don’t care if he
tipped me off and rode over me. When I lose a
race I’m not going to parade any excuses.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never say a word about it, Fred, if that’s
the way you feel,” Polly promised. “But I do
think boys are too queer for anything.”</p>

<p>“Of course they are,” observed Margy from
her seat of state. “I’ve always said they were
funny, but you would never believe it.”</p>

<p>For once in their lives, the children in River
Bend had enough snow. After the coasters went
home, more snow fell, and it continued to snow at
intervals all night. As a result a whole new
world, without a footprint from the day before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
left on it, was ready for inspection the next morning.</p>

<p>“Tell you what let’s do,” remarked Artie, as
they came home from school at noon. “Build a
snowman!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s so much fun,” Margy
maintained.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean just a snowman,” explained
Artie. “Not one of those little ones the kids
build. I mean a great, big giant of a snowman
with a head higher than a house!”</p>

<p>“How would we build a snowman as high as
that?” demanded Fred. “Get in a tree and put
his head on?”</p>

<p>“We could use a stepladder,” said Artie.</p>

<p>Though inclined at first to laugh at this scheme,
the more they discussed it, the better it sounded.</p>

<p>“They had an enormous snowman over in
Stockton,” said Artie, naming a neighboring town.
“Daddy read about it. They built him in the
main square, and every one helped. He had electric
lights for eyes and clothes and everything.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet we could build one just as good,” declared
Ward. “We’ll make ours the tallest
snowman River Bend ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make him a big hat with R.C. on it,” suggested
Polly. “Then every one will know he belongs
to the Riddle Club.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>This idea was pronounced “great,” and the
Riddle Club could hardly wait till school was out
to begin their statue.</p>

<p>A snowball fight was in progress in the school
yard when they went back after lunch, and the battle
continued furiously till the one o’clock bell
rang. Flushed and warm, the pupils marched up
to their classrooms, and on the stairs Polly made a
distressing discovery.</p>

<p>Her precious Riddle Club pin was missing!</p>

<p>These pins had been envied or admired by every
pupil in the school, and there was probably nothing
Polly owned which possessed more value in
her eyes.</p>

<p>She thought the loss warranted writing a note
to Margy, though the teacher severely discouraged
this practice.</p>

<p>“Lost your pin!” Margy’s lips echoed silently,
when she had read the note. “How perfectly awful!
Where?”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head to show she did not know.
But she was afraid she had lost it in the midst of
the snowball battle, and the prospects of recovering
it were exceedingly dim.</p>

<p>Now Margy had sharp eyes when she chose to
use them, and she could be counted on to be interested
in what went on outside her books. While
poor Polly was trying to forget her troubles in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
writing lesson, Margy’s dark eyes were roving
over the room in search of amusement.</p>

<p>Carrie Pepper sat near her, over two aisles, and
she, too, was apparently little interested in the lesson.
When the teacher’s back was turned, Carrie
swiftly passed something to Mattie Helms, who
sat behind her.</p>

<p>“I wonder what she has,” thought Margy, idly.</p>

<p>Mattie’s head bent over something as she examined
it, then she dropped her pencil. It rolled
under the desks and Mattie stooped to get it. As
she straightened up, she dropped the something
lightly on Joe Anderson’s writing book.</p>

<p>Margy could not see, from where she sat, what
the something was, but, like a flash, she guessed.</p>

<p>“Polly’s pin!” She almost said the words
aloud. “Polly’s pin! Carrie was right behind
her coming up the stairs this noon. I’ll bet she
found the pin, and she’s so mean, she won’t give
it back.”</p>

<p>Margy hastily took her pen and attacked the
writing lesson. She wanted to think. Apparently
absorbed in the work before her, she was
planning to find out whether Carrie had really
found the missing pin.</p>

<p>“It’s something so small it doesn’t show when
she has it in her hand,” Margy reasoned. “And
she is showing it to Mattie and Joe, who aren’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
exactly crazy about Polly or our club. I do believe
it is Polly’s pin, and I intend to find out.”</p>

<p>Margy’s writing lesson may have left something
to be desired that day, but by three o’clock she
had a clever plan worked out to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” she said to the impatient five,
who waited for her in the hall. “Yes, I know you
want to get to work on the snowman, but Polly
lost her club pin this noon, and I think I’ve found
it.”</p>

<p>“Lost her pin?” echoed Jess. “Where?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t found it?” gasped Polly.</p>

<p>“Well, of course I’m not sure,” said Margy,
modestly, “but I think I have. I noticed Carrie
walked right behind you this noon, as you were
going upstairs. I didn’t think anything of that
till I saw her passing something around this afternoon.
I couldn’t see what it was, but she showed
it to Mattie Helms and to Joe Anderson.”</p>

<p>“It might be anything,” said Polly, gloomily.</p>

<p>“If it is the pin, what are you going to do about
it?” Fred asked his sister. “You can’t go up and
accuse her of taking Polly’s pin.”</p>

<p>“I could, but I don’t intend to,” said Margy.
“I might ask her and she would say she ‘found’ it.
But I know a better way than that. I’m going
back to our room now and you go out in the yard
and wait for me. It will take me a little while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Look here, what are you up to?” said Fred, a
little quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m going through Carrie’s desk,” returned
Margy, placidly.</p>

<p>“Oh—suppose some one finds you?” said Jess,
with a shiver of fear.</p>

<p>“They won’t. That’s why you have to wait,”
said Margy, who had thought out her plan carefully.
“You see, I figure that if Carrie found the
pin she won’t dare wear it and she won’t take it
home to show her mother, because she would
make her give it back. She can’t do a thing with
it, but keep it to plague Polly and show the Conundrum
Club. So I think she’ll leave it in her desk,
and I mean to take it out.”</p>

<small>RIDDLE CHAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course it wasn’t the right thing to do—to go
through Carrie’s desk. Margy herself had the
feeling that she was in the wrong, but she certainly
didn’t mean to let Carrie keep Polly’s pin
if she had it. Neither did Margy like the idea of
telling the teacher and asking her to have Carrie
search her desk.</p>

<p>“I’m the one to get that pin back, and I’m going
to do it,” thought Margy, as she marched upstairs,
leaving five sober-faced children to wait for
her.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was no one in the classroom
when Margy entered it. She supposed a burglar
must feel as she did when she thrust her right hand
into Carrie’s desk. Two pencils, a box of candy
cough drops, a handkerchief with a gingham border—Margy’s
fingers touched the back of the
desk. There, far up in one corner, she felt something
that pricked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Ouch!” she said, and drew out the pin.</p>

<p>Waiting only to return the things she had taken
out, Margy flew down the stairs and presented
the pin to an astonished and delighted Polly.</p>

<p>“And don’t lose it again,” she lectured her. “I
might not be able to find it so easily a second
time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Polly.</p>

<p>“Did Carrie really have it in her desk?” asked
Jess, round-eyed.</p>

<p>“She certainly did!” replied Margy, as they
started to walk home. “I was almost sure she’d
keep it there.”</p>

<p>“Say, what will she say when she can’t find it
to-morrow morning?” said Artie. “And if she
sees Polly wearing it, what will she think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what she thinks,” broke in Fred.
“The point is, she can’t say anything. She won’t
dare go around saying some one went through
her desk, because she’d sound nice saying that
some one took a Riddle Club pin she found on
the stairs, wouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she wasn’t sure it <i>was</i> my pin,” suggested
Polly.</p>

<p>But the others laughed at this idea. The new
pins Mr. Kirby had sent them were quite unlike
any other pins in the town of River Bend and
certainly Carrie knew them as well as the pins of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
her own Conundrum Club. Besides, wasn’t
Polly’s name on the back?</p>

<p>“Let’s take our pins off before we begin to
build the snowman,” said Polly, when they came
in sight of their homes. “We might easily lose
one in the snow.”</p>

<p>This was hailed as a wise precaution, and they
ran in to put their individual pins in safe places.</p>

<p>Fred stopped short in surprise when he saw
his room. The rug had been taken up, the bed
was rolled in one corner, and his closet door was
wide open. A row of his shoes stood on a newspaper
spread on the window sill and in the center
of his rocking chair sat the precious bank. A
strange woman was down on her hands and knees,
mopping the floor with hot water.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re Fred,” she said, smilingly.
“Your ma set me to cleaning this room this afternoon.
I’ll put things back just the way you had
them.”</p>

<p>Fred put his pin on the cushion on his bureau—which
was covered with a white towel to protect
it from dust—and then glanced at his bank. He
didn’t like to leave it there.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it over to the clubroom and leave it
there, I guess,” he said to himself. “It won’t
hurt to leave it there all night.”</p>

<p>It had been decided to build the gigantic snowman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
between the Marley and the Williamson
house, because they had the advantage of two
large yards filled with snow. Fred found that
Ward and Artie had already started to roll a
ball for the body of the snowman.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” said Fred, joining them:
“What shall we make the letters R.C. of? If
we do them in snow they won’t show up very
well.”</p>

<p>“We can get red flannel or something,” said the
resourceful Polly.</p>

<p>“I think red and white would be pretty, because
Christmas is coming.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can give him a little Christmas
tree to hold,” said Jess. “That would look fine,
wouldn’t it? A great, big snowman, holding a
Christmas tree.”</p>

<p>“There—this is a good place to stand him,” declared
Fred. “Don’t roll the ball any larger.
We can begin to build now.”</p>

<p>They had a fair sized ball of snow rolled, and
Fred had chosen a spot near the walk to have him
stand.</p>

<p>“Get all the snow you can and plaster it against
this ball,” directed Fred. “We’ll have a fat
snowman while we’re about it.”</p>

<p>River Bend was a happy town in which to live,
if you happened to be fond of playing in the snow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
There was no limit to the quantities you could
collect, if you were willing to work and the storm
had been a heavy one. Jess and Ward got out
the wheel-barrow and trundled loads of the white
stuff from their own lawn. As Ward said, it was
a pity to “let it waste.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Fred, suddenly. “We’re
forgetting his legs. If we build him sitting down,
he won’t be nearly tall enough. We must start
two columns, and use them for legs, and then put
the ball of snow on top of them.”</p>

<p>So they set to work and soon had two large,
squatty columns of snow that looked like the piling
in Ward’s father’s wharf.</p>

<p>“The snow packs fine, doesn’t it?” said Polly
to Margy.</p>

<p>The girls were as busy as the boys, hauling
snow and packing it down firmly, and never a
word did Margy say about cold feet. She was
far too interested to pay attention to her feet.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have to lift that ball somehow,”
said Fred, when the legs were pronounced finished.
“You and Polly get on one side, Margy,
and Ward and Artie get over here. Jess and
I’ll take this side.”</p>

<p>The snow was not very heavy to lift, but it
was hard to handle, and so cold that they felt
it through their gloves. With some difficulty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
they finally had it in place, and the statue already
looked like a snowman, Artie declared, stepping
back to view their handiwork.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve come to the place where we’ll
have to have a stepladder,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we use the loft ladder?” asked
Jess. “That’s light and easy to carry.”</p>

<p>“We can’t lean it against the snowman—he’d
topple over,” replied Fred. “We have a stepladder,
but I noticed it up in our hall. The
cleaning woman was probably using it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get ours,” offered Polly. “I know where
it is—on the back porch. I can bring it.”</p>

<p>Fred and Artie went with her and brought the
ladder back. Then it had to be set up with care,
for every one knows that a stepladder takes delight
in falling over just as you reach the top step.
Fred opened it and fastened the bars and ran
lightly up to the top to test it.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said. “Say, this is fun.
We can pretend we’re brick-layers and bring up
hods filled with snow.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any hods,” Ward reminded him.</p>

<p>“That flat board will do,” said Fred. “Here,
give it to me; I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>He took a flat light board that happened to
be on the ground and scooped two handfuls of
snow on it. Then he mounted the ladder, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the board and the snow, and deposited them
on the square little shelf that was under the top
step.</p>

<p>“Here you are, Riddle Chap,” he addressed
the snowman’s body. “We are going to make
you the best looking chap for miles around.”</p>

<p>“Riddle Chap!” cried Artie. “That’s fine,
Fred. We’ll call him that. His initials stand
for Riddle Chap, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, he has to have a name,” Fred
chuckled. “If we’re going to make him as large
as life, he’ll need a name so we can introduce
him to our friends.”</p>

<p>Each of the boys and girls took turns going
up and down the ladder and each added some
new beauty to the snowman. He had buttons on
his waistcoat, and arms that crooked at the elbows—that
was Polly’s idea. She had taken two
pieces of old rubber hose and bent them to look
like arms. The snow had been carefully packed
around and over these.</p>

<p>Ward and Artie made the neck, and they all
shaped the head with its peaked cap. Margy insisted
that the initials were not to go on till the
head was in place, and this proved a wise plan,
for they dropped the head three times and had
to do it over before Fred and Artie finally succeeded
in putting it on the neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Oh, for pity’s sake!” cried Polly, watching
from the ground. “You have it turned all the
way around! The poor snowman is looking
backward.”</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully, Fred turned the head
till it faced in the right direction. Then Margy
handed up the letters cut from strips of red flannel,
and Fred put them on the visor of the cap.
The snowman had coal black eyes, a mouth like
a red pepper, and ears that bore a resemblance
to orange peel. He was very tall indeed—far
taller than any of those who had made him—and
when his makers looked at him they were agreed
that he was quite the largest statue they had ever
tried to build.</p>

<p>“If it’s cold to-night, we can throw water over
it and let it freeze,” said Fred, standing off a little
to admire his handiwork.</p>

<p>“There’s Carrie,” said Jess, in a low tone.
“See her coming out? I guess she is going to
the post-office.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Carrie called, from
across the street. “What’s that funny thing?”</p>

<p>Before they could answer her, she had crossed
over and was staring at the snowman.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the queer things to do!” said Carrie.
“Regular child play, I call it, building a
snowman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“That’s some snowman you have there!” called
a hearty voice, and Harry Worden crossed from
the other side of the street. “I’ll take a picture
of him to-morrow for you, when the sun is out.
I don’t think I ever saw as large a one as that.”</p>

<p>“Is it as large as the one they had in Stockton
last year?” asked Artie, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Much taller,” replied Harry. “I’d like to
get a snapshot of this one. Don’t let anything
happen to him, and I’ll be around in the afternoon
as soon as school is out.”</p>

<p>Carrie went on to the post-office. It was nearly
dark, and in a few minutes the five o’clock whistle
would sound.</p>

<p>“Gee, it will be nice to have a picture of our
snowman,” said Artie. “We can frame it and
have it in our clubroom.”</p>

<p>Fred looked a little startled.</p>

<p>“Speaking of the clubroom reminds me of
something,” he said hurriedly. “Mind if I go
over to your house, Artie?”</p>

<p>“Sure, come on,” replied Artie, hospitably.
“Want that book I said I’d lend you?”</p>

<p>“I want to go up to the clubroom a minute,”
explained Fred.</p>

<p>But when he went upstairs with Artie, the clubroom
door was locked. Ward had the key as
usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I started to bring the bank over here this afternoon,”
said Fred, a little worried frown between
his eyes. “I thought I did it. But if I
didn’t, what <i>did</i> I do with the bank?”</p>

<p>“Maybe you left it in your own room,” said
Artie, comfortably.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I didn’t,” Fred answered. “But it
won’t hurt to go and look. I might have put it
down again without thinking.”</p>

<p>“Lots of times I think I’ve done a thing and
haven’t,” observed Artie, trotting beside Fred, as
he went back to the Williamson house. “And
sometimes I think I didn’t do a thing and it turns
out that I did.”</p>

<p>But neither of these “thinks” proved of much
help to Fred. The bank was not in his room,
now in perfect, shining order with his things in
their accustomed places. It was not on the hall
table where he had once left it. In fact, the sad
fact dawned on Fred, slowly and unhappily, that
he had lost the bank and its precious contents.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>LOST TREASURES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Let’s</span> go out and look in the snow,” suggested
Artie. “You must have dropped it between your
house and ours.”</p>

<p>As the two boys opened the front door a whirl
of snow flew in their faces. In the brief time
they had been within doors a new snowstorm had
gained headway.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” called Fred, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Who’s that yourself?” Carrie Pepper’s voice
retorted. “Your old snowman is enough to scare
any one going by—they’ll think it is a giant.”</p>

<p>Carrie hurried across the street with the mail,
and Fred tried not to think she might have been
hunting around the snowman.</p>

<p>“She <i>was</i> stooped over,” he said to himself.
“But she may have dropped a letter. Anyway, I
don’t suppose she would take the bank if she found
it.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered Polly’s pin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“She might think it would plague me,” he
thought. And he had to admit that if that was
Carrie’s plan—always provided she had found
the bank—she could not think of a better plan
for teasing him.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t here, that’s all,” declared Artie,
brushing the snow off his gloves after an unsuccessful
grubbing about in the snow. “I don’t see
what you could have done with it, Fred.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fred!” Jess’s voice came to them out of
the storm. “Is that you? I came back to look
for my glove. I don’t suppose you’ve seen it?”</p>

<p>“Your glove?” repeated Fred. “Is that lost?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, and it’s a brand new one,” returned
Jess, ready to cry. “Mother got them for me
when she went to the city. They’re brushed
wool, and they’re gauntlets, and they cost six dollars!”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s tough luck,” said Artie, sympathetically.
“But I don’t believe you lost it around
here, Jess. I’ve been all around the snowman
on my hands and knees, and I would have found
it if it had been anywhere around.”</p>

<p>“Did you lose something, too?” asked Jess, surprised.</p>

<p>Fred was in no mood to hide his troubles.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost the bank,” he said abruptly. “And
all the club money in it. I had it before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
started to build the snowman, and now I can’t
find it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it in your house?” asked Jess.</p>

<p>Fred explained where he and Artie had looked.</p>

<p>“Well, I never heard of such a thing!” said
Jess. “My good glove and your bank gone!
Somebody must have picked them up—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Carrie Pepper was out here when we started
to look,” Artie announced.</p>

<p>“Then she found it!” cried Jess. “I’m going
right over now to her house and ask her to give
me back my glove. You come along, Fred, and
make her give you the bank. That’s the same as
stealing, to take things like that.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t stealing to take one glove,” protested
Artie.</p>

<p>“’Tis, too,” insisted Jess. “What good is one
glove? No good at all! Carrie Pepper knows
those gloves are new. She has to give it back to
me, that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you take my advice and go mighty slow
about accusing any one of taking your glove,” said
Fred, earnestly. “I’d no more go to her and ask
her for the bank than I’d fly. I might as well
come right out and say she stole it.”</p>

<p>“She took Polly’s pin, didn’t she?” Jess demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s different. Lots of people might take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
a pin, and they wouldn’t take money. Besides,
how do we know Carrie didn’t intend to give the
pin back to Polly? Margy didn’t give her a
chance to return it.”</p>

<p>“Jess! Jessie! Come in right away!” called
Mrs. Larue.</p>

<p>Jess had to go in to supper without her glove,
and Artie went home, too. Fred looked around
in the snow for a few minutes longer, but the
storm was increasing and he finally gave up. He
could hardly touch his supper, and afterward he
told his father what had happened.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t put the money in the bank,
as you said,” poor Fred concluded his story.
“But I never thought I could lose a thing like a
bank.”</p>

<p>“Well, Fred, it seems as though it must turn
up,” Mr. Williamson said, trying to speak cheerfully.
“I don’t see, myself, how a bank and its
money contents could disappear, unless some one
has stolen it. And we won’t think that.”</p>

<p>“Try to remember where you had it last,
Fred,” his mother suggested.</p>

<p>“Why, I <i>thought</i> I took it over to the Marleys’
to leave in the clubroom,” said Fred. “I can’t
remember letting it out of my hand. But the
room was locked and Ward hadn’t been near it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you left it somewhere else in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Marleys’,” said Mrs. Williamson, “and you were
in such a hurry to get out and build the snowman,
you did not notice. If Artie or Polly find it,
they’ll be over to tell you.”</p>

<p>But neither Polly nor Artie found the bank.
Fred went over there before going to bed—and
had to plough through several inches of fresh
snow—but none of the Marley family had seen
the bank.</p>

<p>In the morning the window sills were banked
high with snow and there were no foot prints
around the snowman, who stood tall and strong, a
handsome guard for the street.</p>

<p>“We’ll give him a tree to hold before Harry
Worden comes to take his picture,” said Ward,
eagerly.</p>

<p>But Fred felt little interest in the snowman.
He could think of nothing but the missing bank.</p>

<p>“I’ll resign as treasurer,” he said to Polly, on
their way to school.</p>

<p>The sun was out and the snow had stopped. A
white world, brilliant and beautiful, was spread
before their eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll resign,” said Fred. “I’m not fit to be
treasurer and take care of other people’s money.
I’m too careless. And I’ll save every cent of my
allowance and pay all the money back to the club.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Fred,” Polly told him loyally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
“We don’t want you to resign. No one will be
as good a treasurer as you are.”</p>

<p>“I’m no good at all,” said Fred, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are, too!” flashed Polly. “You’re
fine. It isn’t exactly your fault that the bank is
lost. Every one is likely to lose things. You
don’t have to have to make the money up, either.
If one of us had lost it, you wouldn’t make him
pay the money back. Besides, Mother says she
is sure the bank will be found.”</p>

<p>“Did she say that?” asked Fred, hopefully.
“Daddy thought so, too. I wish it would be
found, but I feel it is gone for good. And the
worst of it is, I can’t remember putting it down
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose Carrie Pepper will say
when she sees me wearing my pin?” said Polly,
hoping to take Fred’s mind off his troubles.</p>

<p>Instead, she only succeeded in starting his
thoughts on another tack. Had Carrie Pepper
found anything in the snow the night before?
Or was she merely feeling around for a letter or
parcel she might have dropped?</p>

<p>“I hate these ugly old mittens,” Jess was complaining
to Margy. “They’re not a bit pretty,
and they’re not nearly as warm as my lovely
gloves. Mother says maybe she’ll get me a new
pair for my birthday in February, but I’ll have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
wear these horrid old things till then, because I’m
so careless.”</p>

<p>Margy, not having lost any treasure, felt free
to keep an eye on Carrie and observe the effect
of Polly’s pin on her. Polly had the pin in its
usual place—above the pocket of her middy
blouse, and Carrie apparently did not notice it until
Polly went to the board during the arithmetic
lesson.</p>

<p>“There—she’s seen it,” said Margy to herself,
as Carrie stared.</p>

<p>Then, heedless of the lesson, Carrie began to
rummage through her desk. She pulled out the
box of cough drops, the pencils, the handkerchief,
and an apple she had brought for recess. Then,
keeping her eye on the board as though she were
following the example, her hands began to explore
the desk. She was feeling for the pin.</p>

<p>Perhaps the intensity of Margy’s gaze made
her glance over her shoulder. Margy’s eyes
were dancing. A sudden, deep flush spread over
Carrie’s face.</p>

<p>“Now she knows,” said Margy to herself.
“And the next time she finds anything that doesn’t
belong to her, I hope she’ll give it up.”</p>

<p>Harry Worden came that afternoon and took a
picture of “Riddle Chap,” but Fred could think
only of his bank and Jess was looking for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
glove all the time the snapshots were being taken.
It was lucky that something happened to distract
their attention and, in the case of Fred, it was
doubly welcome. He felt so bad to think he had
lost the money belonging to the club that his
mother was afraid he would worry himself sick.</p>

<p>“You try to get the prize riddle, Fred,” Mrs.
Williamson told him. “That will give the treasury
a good start again.”</p>

<p>Fred said he would try, but that noon he came
home from school, excited and eager.</p>

<p>“The principal was telling us this morning in
assembly, Mother,” said Fred, “that there is a
family in River Bend who is just about starving
to death. The town is going to take care of
them, but there are six children in the family and
they want to give them a real Christmas. The
day before school closes they’re going to take up
a collection.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you want me to tell you and
Margy how to earn some money,” said Mrs. Williamson,
smiling.</p>

<p>“No, I have a new scheme,” said Fred.
“We’re going to have a session of the Riddle
Club before Christmas. I haven’t had a chance
to talk this over with Polly yet, but I thought it
would be fine if we had an open meeting and asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the fathers and mothers to come. The way you
did in camp this summer, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with the Christmas
collection,” said Margy, who was listening.</p>

<p>“It has a lot to do with it,” Fred retorted. “I
thought that, instead of paying forfeits when
Mother and the others missed a riddle, they could
pay money, and we could give the money to the
poor children. And if we missed riddles, we’d
pay, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, Fred, I like that plan very much,” said
his mother. “I’m sure Polly will like it, too.
Tell her as soon as you can, so you’ll all have time
to study up hard riddles.”</p>

<p>“You won’t mind not being able to guess them,
will you, Mother?” laughed Margy. “You like
to help people along.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Williamson heard of this plan, he
was even more enthusiastic than his wife. He
said he had a plan of his own, but that he would
keep it a secret till the meeting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A PRACTICAL JOKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> approved of Fred’s plan the moment she
heard it; and the Riddle Club members fell upon
the riddle books—well-worn by this time—old
scrap books, and clippings and even went about
among their acquaintances, collecting difficult riddles.</p>

<p>“For we must make them as hard as we can,”
said Polly, earnestly. “Then no one will be able
to guess them and we’ll have heaps of money to
take to school for the collection.”</p>

<p>But, of course, they couldn’t think of riddles
every hour in the day, no matter how interested
they were in the coming meeting. There was, as
Artie observed, “a good deal of weather going
on,” and it alternately rained and snowed for
three days. This added to the beauty of the
snowman, for he grew a little icicle beard, and he
wore earrings, too, formed of the melted and
frozen snow.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to break those off,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Ward, much scandalized. “I never saw a man
wear earrings.”</p>

<p>“Don’t touch that snowman,” ordered Fred.
“If he wants to wear earrings, let him! Every
one says he is the biggest snow statue we ever
had in River Bend, and we’re not going to spoil
him picking on him.”</p>

<p>The pictures Harry Worden had taken turned
out beautifully, and he had had an enlargement
made for the Riddle Club clubroom. Mrs. Marley
cleverly framed it in an old frame that fitted
exactly, and the snowman hung on the wall of the
pretty clubroom and was much admired.</p>

<p>Though Fred had searched diligently for his
bank and never ceased to mourn it, he could not
find it, nor even a trace of where it might have
been. Jess sympathized with him deeply—as
indeed they all did, for Fred had been so very
proud of the money saved.</p>

<p>“I’d give anything, if I could find that bank,”
said Fred, twenty times a day. “I don’t see what
I could have done with it. And why can’t I remember
where I put it down or where I had it
last?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jess would sigh. “I don’t
see, myself, how you could lose a whole bank.
But then, I lost my lovely glove, and the one
that’s left isn’t a bit of good. And they cost six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
dollars—they were real brushed wool. Oh, dear,
it’s awful to lose things, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care if I’d lost a glove,” said Fred.
“I wouldn’t mind losing anything of mine, even
my new stickpin Aunt Katherine sent me. Because
that would be mine and it wouldn’t affect
any one else. But here I’ve gone and lost all the
money that belongs to the Riddle Club! I’m saving
my allowance, but it will be a million years
before I get enough saved to make up for what
I lost. What’s a glove, compared to a bank?”</p>

<p>Along about this time of year school began to
be what Jess called “exciting.” The classes stayed
after school several afternoons to make decorations
for the auditorium, where a Christmas party
was always held. This year Polly had learned
how to make pretty red flowers, and Miss Elliott,
her teacher, suggested that if long wreaths were
braided of crêpe paper strands and these flowers
placed at intervals, the effect would be very
pretty.</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal of work,” Miss Elliott said;
“but the festoons will stay up till we come back
to school after the holidays. There’ll be a good
many visitors at the school, just before Christmas,
and we’d like the auditorium to look its best.
If you’ll make the flowers, Polly, we’ll all help
braid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Polly was glad to make the flowers, and she
stayed after school for an hour or two every
afternoon, cutting and pasting.</p>

<p>“I’m so sick of braiding this silly old paper,”
Carrie Pepper complained to Mattie Helms. “I
think it’s mean we never have any of the fun. All
Polly Marley has to do is to sit there and make
flowers. Any one can make flowers, and it’s interesting.
Not like braiding this stuff.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think her flowers are much,” commented
Mattie. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing extra,” said Carrie. “There
goes Fred Williamson. He looks at me so funny,
every time he sees me.”</p>

<p>Carrie did not know it, but Fred was almost
sure she had taken his bank. He could not see
her without wondering if she really would do a
thing like that. He did not believe, for an instant,
that she would take the bank and use the
money, for that would be stealing; but he thought
she might keep it, as she had Polly’s pin, to torment
him. He tried to imagine what she would
say if he should walk up to her some day and ask
her to hand back the bank. But he never did ask
her, for his common sense told him he had nothing
to uphold his suspicions and that it would be
rather foolish to accuse Carrie of taking anything
when he had no proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Polly worked on the flowers one afternoon till
she had two dozen ready, all but the long green
stems.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take these home,” she said to
Miss Elliott. “I can wrap the wire there and
finish them easily.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan,” Miss Elliott replied.
“Here’s a pasteboard box to carry them in. But
don’t try to do them all to-night, Polly—you
ought to play outdoors an hour before you have
supper. It’s a shame to miss all this good coasting.”</p>

<p>Polly put her flowers and the things she would
need to finish them into the box her teacher gave
her. She had just reached the steps when some
one hailed her.</p>

<p>“Hey, Polly!” her brother shouted. “Come
on over here! We’re firing at targets!”</p>

<p>Polly looked. The boys had tacked up an
empty tin can on one of the trees in the school
yard and they were firing snowballs into it—that
is, if a snowball went into it, it counted a bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>“You watch me, Polly!” cried Artie, as Polly
put her box down on the step and came running
across the yard. “Bet you I hit it this time!”</p>

<p>He packed a firm, damp snowball, took careful
aim, and fired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Did it!” he shrieked. “Told you so!”</p>

<p>Fred laughed and handed a ready-made ball to
Polly.</p>

<p>“You try,” he said.</p>

<p>Polly stepped back a few feet, shut her eyes,
and threw the ball. It struck the tree a few feet
above the tin can.</p>

<p>“Don’t shut your eyes,” instructed Fred.
“You want to aim. Here, try again,” and he
gave her a second ball.</p>

<p>This time Polly hit the tree below the can. But
her third trial was more successful, and the snowball
went neatly into the can, scoring what Artie
enthusiastically informed her was “a peach of a
bull’s-eye.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay another minute,” said Polly, when
they asked her to try again. “Where’s Jess and
Margy? I have to go on home and finish some
more flowers.”</p>

<p>“Jess had to go to the dentist and Margy went
to take a music lesson,” Fred recited.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course—yes, I remember,” said Polly.
“Margy is coming over to-night to practice our
duet.”</p>

<p>Polly and Margy were to play a duet at the
Christmas party in school.</p>

<p>Picking up the box she had left on the steps,
Polly hurried off home, while the boys continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to hurl snowballs at the tomato can with varying
success but unwaning enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t work on those flowers now, Polly,”
said Mrs. Marley, when she saw her daughter.
“You’ve been indoors all day, and you’ll feel much
better if you take your sled and have a coast or
two before it’s dark. I’ll help you with the flowers
after supper and we’ll get them done in less
than an hour.”</p>

<p>So Polly went out again and met Margy, now
through with her lesson, and they had four trips
down the hill and back with their sleds before the
five o’clock whistle sounded.</p>

<p>When Polly came in, she went upstairs to brush
her hair. She had left the box of flowers on the
bed in her room, and she was surprised to find a
dark stain spreading over the counterpane.</p>

<p>“What in the world is that?” she said, in astonishment.</p>

<p>She lifted the box hastily. It was heavy with
water, and it was water that had seeped through
the pasteboard and made the stain.</p>

<p>Polly tore off the lid—melted snow!</p>

<p>“Some one put it there!” she cried. “But
where are my flowers? I had them in the box—I
never took them out—I don’t see——”</p>

<p>She called her mother, and together they puzzled
over it as they changed the bed clothes, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
even the blankets were soaked through from the
water.</p>

<p>“Some one has played a trick on you,” said
Mrs. Marley, spreading clean sheets. “The paper
flowers were light, so they could substitute
snow without making a difference in weight.
Where did you leave the box?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave it——” Polly began.</p>

<p>Then she remembered.</p>

<p>“I put it down on the school steps while I tried
to throw a snowball into the tomato can,” she
said. “But there was no one in the school yard,
except the boys, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, that is when the trick was
done,” declared Mrs. Marley. “Some one took
out the flowers and the paper and wires and filled
the box with snow. It’s a mean thing to do, I’ll
admit; but I don’t suppose they thought you’d put
the box on the bed. They must have counted on
your opening the box as soon as you reached
home.”</p>

<p>“But I promised Miss Elliott to bring her the
flowers in the morning,” said poor Polly, looking
very much as though she might cry. “She wants
them to put in the new rope that’s already
braided.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Polly,” said her mother. “You’ll
have the flowers. I have always said that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
best way to pay a practical joker back, is not to
let him know his joke has been a success. We’ll
get Artie and Jess and Ward and Fred and
Margy to come and help, and, working together,
we can make and finish two dozen flowers this
evening. Then, when you take them to school,
don’t say a word about the missing ones. Whoever
played the trick will be waiting to hear you
complain, and if you act as though nothing had
happened they’ll be more surprised than you were
when you opened this box.”</p>

<p>When the others heard what had happened,
they were eager to help. Fortunately, Polly had
the materials for making the flowers on hand, and
as soon as supper was over the six chums set busily
to work. Polly and her mother cut the flower
patterns and helped start them, but the others
soon learned how to fold and paste, and they refused
to stop and rest until the full two dozen
flowers were finished and neatly packed in another
box.</p>

<p>“And here’s a little ice-cream,” said Mr. Marley,
coming in as the scissors were being put away.
“I thought the least I could do for such an industrious
circle was to get them a little refreshment,
since I have no talent for making paper
flowers.”</p>

<p>The next morning Carrie Pepper and Mattie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Helms watched to see what Polly would say when
Miss Elliott came. To their intense surprise,
Polly marched up to the desk and put down a
pasteboard box.</p>

<p>“I finished the flowers, Miss Elliott,” she said
clearly.</p>

<p>Carrie looked at Mattie. They both felt a
little foolish. And though neither would admit
it, they admired Polly, who, instead of complaining
and “fussing,” had evidently managed in some
mysterious way to get her flowers finished on
time.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, that’s done,” said Polly, with
a sigh of relief, as she went back to her seat.
“Now we can have the Riddle Club meeting to-night
and enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE SPECIAL MEETING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night it began to snow again, the fine,
steady snow that always promises a real storm.
When Mr. Marley came home to supper, his
overcoat was covered with the white flakes.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that every one lives near,” said Mrs.
Marley, lighting another electric lamp to make
the dining-room more cheerful. “No one would
want to go very far on a night like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they would, Mother, if they were going
to the Riddle Club,” Artie assured her. “I’d go
anywhere to a Riddle Club meeting.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley laughed and said she was thankful
she didn’t have to tramp through a snowstorm
to reach the meeting.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovely to have this room?” said Polly
to Artie, when, a little later, they went upstairs
to the warm, well-lighted, pretty clubroom. Artie
had borrowed the key from Ward, because
they wanted to make sure the heat was turned on
before the guests arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Think how it would be out in the barn on a
night like this,” remarked Artie, breathing on the
window panes so that he could see out. “Gee,
Polly, it’s snowing yet.”</p>

<p>A stamping and scuffling on the porch announced
that the members and guests of the Riddle
Club had arrived. The Williamsons, of
course, had come from no further away than the
next house and the Larues from across the street,
but they were covered with the snow. They took
off their coats and shook them on the porch, and
even then, when Mr. Williamson took off his
hat inside the house, a powdery shower of white
fell to the rug.</p>

<p>Polly glanced at her mother as though to remind
her of something.</p>

<p>“You’ll want to have a business meeting before
we come upstairs,” said Mrs. Marley, pleasantly.
“So run on up, children, and when you are ready
for us, let Artie call.”</p>

<p>Polly led the way up to the clubroom and called
the meeting to order promptly.</p>

<p>“This is to be a short business meeting,” she
said gravely. “We have no unfinished business
to consider and so there is only one thing to do.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the unsuspecting Fred.</p>

<p>“Collect the dues,” said Polly, holding out a
new copper bank to the club treasurer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Margy declared afterward that she thought
Fred was going to cry. His face got very red,
and for a moment he did not say anything.</p>

<p>“You want me to collect the dues?” he asked,
when he did speak. “Dues from you, after I
lost all the club money?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” said Jess, from her corner.
“Everybody knows you didn’t lose the bank purposely.
We’ve all brought our money, and it’s
up to you to collect it.”</p>

<p>And Jess walked over and put a shining new
dime in the slit in the bank. Artie followed her.</p>

<p>Never had Fred, in his experience as treasurer,
found it so easy to collect dues from the entire
membership. Even Ward did not argue, but insisted
on paying his dime. And none of them
would hear of Fred giving the bank to any one
else to take care of, or leaving it in the clubroom.</p>

<p>“You’re the treasurer, and you take care of it,”
said Polly. “You suit us, and if we don’t fuss
about the money that’s lost I don’t see why you
should. Artie, go call the folks to come up.”</p>

<p>The grown-ups came in and sat down in the
chairs provided for them. Polly, who was now
used to talking “standing up,” as she said, thought
it best to explain the purpose of the meeting again.</p>

<p>“This is a special kind of session of the Riddle
Club,” she said earnestly. “Instead of forfeits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the ones who fail to guess a riddle must pay
money, and the money collected is going to school,
to be used for a poor family. But don’t try
flunking the riddles, because that isn’t fair.”</p>

<p>“You’d rather have good sportsmanship than
a tray full of money, Polly?” asked Mr. Williamson,
smiling.</p>

<p>Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“If we win the prize riddle to-night, we’re going
to give that to the collection, too,” she said.</p>

<p>“That reminds me of something I have to say,”
Mr. Williamson declared. “I said I had a secret
for you, and this is it: I’ll pay ten cents to the
school collection for every riddle that is guessed
correctly here to-night and an extra five dollars if
the prize riddle is solved, the extra money to go
in the club bank.”</p>

<p>Polly saw that Mr. Williamson had chosen that
way of helping Fred make up the money lost, and
she thought it was a most generous way. She
didn’t say so, but she smiled at Mr. Williamson
and he knew that she understood what he was
trying to do.</p>

<p>“I thought we’d open the answers to the prize
riddle first,” said Polly.</p>

<p>Choosing from the six folded papers on the
table before her, she opened one and read it
aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“The riddle was, ‘Why do pianos bear the
noblest characters?’ And this answer says, ‘Because
they’re always cheerful.’”</p>

<p>“They’re not,” said Margy, positively. “I
guess I ought to know.”</p>

<p>“No piano is cheerful when you’re practicing
your music lesson on it,” agreed Mrs. Williamson,
smiling.</p>

<p>“The second answer reads, ‘Because they keep
in tune,’” read Polly.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” said Mr. Williamson. “But it
doesn’t happen to be the one we’re after.”</p>

<p>Polly picked up a third paper.</p>

<p>“This one says, ‘Because pianos are expensive.’”
She tried not to laugh when she read this.
She recognized the writing as Artie’s.</p>

<p>“Here’s another,” she said hurriedly. “‘Pianos
bear the noblest characters because they are
grand, upright, and square.’ Why, that must be
right!” added Polly, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Correct!” said Mr. Williamson. “See if that
last paper has solved it, too. No? Well, then,
will the prize winner please step forward and receive
the prize?”</p>

<p>To the utter astonishment of the roomful,
Margy came forward.</p>

<p>“Margy Williamson, you never guessed a riddle,
did you?” gasped her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>If it had been Fred, no one would have wondered.
But Margy! She who always complained
that every riddle was too hard, that she
couldn’t spell the words in them or do the arithmetic
they demanded of her. Margy!</p>

<p>“It isn’t very complimentary to be so upset,
Margy,” said her daddy, putting a little white
box in her hand; “but I must say you are the last
member of the Riddle Club I thought would solve
a prize riddle.”</p>

<p>Margy grinned and opened her box. In it
were two beautiful five dollar gold pieces.</p>

<p>“One goes in the bank,” she said, slipping it in
as she spoke, “and the other goes on the tray for
the school collection,” and she put the gold piece
on the silver tray Mrs. Marley had loaned for
this special occasion.</p>

<p>“How did you ever guess it?” Ward asked respectfully.</p>

<p>It was a question that each one had wanted to
ask.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” Margy explained, “I can’t
guess riddles unless I have time to think about
’em. I thought and thought and <i>thought</i> about
this one. Every time I sat down to practice, I
thought some more. Then I heard Miss Elliott
talking to the music supervisor one day, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
said something about our school piano being out
of date.</p>

<p>“‘No school uses the old square pianos if they
can get uprights,’ she said.</p>

<p>“I looked ‘upright’ up in the dictionary,”
Margy went on, “and I found there was more
than one meaning and one meant ‘honest and
square’; so I guessed both words could count.
And Mattie Helms told me one day in school
that she was going to take music lessons as soon
as her mother bought a grand piano—and there
I had another word to use. They all fitted in,
so I just used them.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Margy!” cried Mr. Larue,
clapping his hands. “You deserve to win the
prize.”</p>

<p>They all clapped Margy, and she settled down
happily again on the window seat, between Artie
and Jess.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll ask the riddle,” said Polly.
“Margy, you begin, because you won.”</p>

<p>“Daddy Williamson,” said Margy, seriously,
“What is that which by losing an eye has nothing
left but a nose?”</p>

<p>“A one-eyed man?” guessed Mr. Williamson.</p>

<p>“Forfeit!” cried Ward, so excited that he
couldn’t keep still. “It’s noise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Well, let Margy tell her own answers to her
own riddles, Ward,” reproved Polly.</p>

<p>“How much is the forfeit to be?” asked Mr.
Williamson.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to pay any,” said
Polly. “You gave us ten dollars, and that’s
enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to pay a forfeit,” Mr. Williamson
insisted. “Like my daughter, I don’t seem to be
able to spell without thinking. Suppose we pay
ten cents for the riddles we miss?”</p>

<p>The others were willing, so Mr. Williamson
put ten cents on the silver tray.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Ward, at a sign from Polly,
“What is the difference between a schoolmaster
and an engineer?”</p>

<p>“One trains the mind, the other minds the
train,” answered Mrs. Larue, with a smile.
“That was a pet riddle of mine years ago, Ward.”</p>

<p>“I guess you told it to me,” admitted Ward,
“but I forgot.”</p>

<p>“Ten cents for the collection,” said Mr. Williamson,
putting down a dime on the tray.</p>

<p>It was Jess’s turn to ask her father.</p>

<p>“What is that which never asks questions, yet
requires many answers?” asked Jess, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I should say a-a-a- oh, Jess, I’ll pay ten cents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
gladly for the answer,” said Mr. Larue, placing
two nickels with the other change.</p>

<p>“It’s a doorbell,” said Jess.</p>

<p>“Artie,” nodded Polly. “Your turn.”</p>

<p>“What mechanic never turns to the left,
Mother?” he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>“The bricklayer?” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Forfeit!” cried Artie. “It’s the wheelwright.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley paid her money and explained to
Ward what a wheelwright was, and then Fred was
ready to tackle his mother.</p>

<p>“Bet you can’t guess this, Mother,” he said.
“Of what trade were all the presidents of the
United States?”</p>

<p>“Why, Fred, cabinet makers, of course,” replied
Mrs. Williamson.</p>

<p>“Here’s the ten cents for you, Mother,” said
Mr. Williamson, gleefully. “I’m glad one of us
solved a riddle.”</p>

<p>“Polly’s last,” said Ward. “Go on, Polly, ask
your dad.”</p>

<p>“Why is an egg lightly boiled like one boiled
too much, Daddy?” asked Polly, smiling.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about cooking,” said Mr.
Marley, pretending to frown. “Is it because you
can’t eat it?”</p>

<p>“Forfeit, Daddy!” cried Artie. “He’s wrong,
isn’t he, Polly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“The answer is, ‘Because it is hardly done,’”
said Polly, holding out her hand for the ten cents.</p>

<p>They had planned to ask each other riddles,
but when Mrs. Marley suggested they all go
down to the kitchen and make molasses candy and
cool it in the snow, the members of the Riddle
Club decided that they had had enough riddles.</p>

<p>“We put our five dollars into the collection, so
we are not being selfish,” said Polly, soberly.
“How much money have we for the poor family,
Fred?”</p>

<p>“Counting the five dollars, we have five dollars
and sixty cents,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” said Polly and Jess together,
and Mr. Larue added forty cents more to make
the fund six dollars.</p>

<small>MERRY CHRISTMAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> molasses candy was a great success and
so was the school collection the next day. When
Polly told Miss Elliott how they had collected the
six dollars, the teacher thought it was such an interesting
story that she asked Polly to tell it before
the assembly. Polly was too shy, but Fred
was persuaded, and when he had finished speaking,
the principal had a few words to say.</p>

<p>“I’d like the Riddle Club to know,” he said,
“that we all admire their energy and generosity.
They could have asked their parents for the
money, but instead they held this novel meeting.
And the girl who won the prize for the riddle
could have kept the money for something else,
but she chose to send it to girls who have nothing.
To-day is the first time I have heard in detail of
the Riddle Club, but I shall always remember it
after this morning.”</p>

<p>Dear, dear, wasn’t the Riddle Club pleased and
embarrassed and proud, all at once!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Carrie Pepper looked as though she could
cheerfully bite you, Polly,” said Jess, at recess.
“I don’t believe she liked to hear us talked about
that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s all right,” said Polly. “If you
don’t look out, Jess, you’ll be like Fred. He can’t
say one good thing about Carrie. I don’t believe
he even speaks to her now.”</p>

<p>School closed two days before Christmas, and
the party, which the entire school attended, was
one long two hours of fun and laughter. Margy
and Polly played their duet and there were recitations.
A huge Christmas tree was trimmed
entirely with things to eat. Popcorn and peanuts
and strings of cranberries and doughnuts tied
on with red ribbons, cookies strung together like
necklaces, red apples, oranges cut in fancy shapes,
net bags of candy, bars of chocolate done up to
look like presents—that tree looked as any
Christmas tree would look trimmed for a party,
but there wasn’t a single decoration on it that
couldn’t be eaten.</p>

<p>The children ate everything on it, too, before
going home, and then it was carried out in the
school yard and planted in the snow to serve as
a dinner table for the birds. The older boys
climbed it and fastened bits of suet to the highest
branches, and Christmas morning those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
passed the yard saw flocks of hungry birds enjoying
a holiday feast.</p>

<p>“We must fix Riddle Chap up for Christmas,”
suggested Polly, as they walked home after the
party.</p>

<p>Riddle Chap had had his tree to hold long ago,
but as Polly pointed out, there was nothing on
it.</p>

<p>“He needs a cheerful necktie,” Fred declared.
“I’ll get him that red one with purple spots that
Daddy never wears.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put suet in the tree for the birds,” said
Jess. “They’ll like that. And we can hang a
wreath around his neck.”</p>

<p>“We’ll trim him all over!” cried Polly, joyously.
“Give him a wreath and wind ground
pine around his body and stick a holly spray in
his hat.”</p>

<p>They were as good as their word, and Riddle
Chap, on Christmas Eve, was as gay as any snowman
who ever had Christmas dreams. He wore
a wreath about his throat, a fearfully bright necktie
under his chin, holly in his hat, and his arms
and legs were wound with ropes of ground pine.</p>

<p>Polly and Margy liked to consider themselves
almost grown up—at times—and Fred was sure
he was much older than Ward and Artie. Jess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
who was a year older than Margy, liked to romp
too well to desire “grown-upness,” as she called
it. But when Christmas Eve came, each member
of the Riddle Club discovered that hanging up
one’s stocking was half the fun of Christmas, and
Polly and Margy and Fred were just as eager as
Artie and Jess and Ward.</p>

<p>“Come over early,” they told each other when
they said good-night, after the snowman was arrayed.
“Come over early and see our things.”</p>

<p>Artie may have started for Ward’s house—at
least, that is what he always said he was doing,
though his mother declared he must have been
dreaming. Anyway, long before daylight, the
Marley household was awakened by a tremendous
crash.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Marley rushed out from their
room, meeting Polly in the hall.</p>

<p>“Where’s Artie?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” called Artie, sweetly. “I guess
I kind of fell downstairs. The globe fell off the
lamp on the newel post.”</p>

<p>Artie wasn’t hurt—though it was a wonder, for
the broken glass from the globe was strewn all
around him—and he did not seem to be sleepy at
all. Perhaps the fall had awakened him. However,
his father said that no one was to think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
opening Christmas presents at half-past three in
the morning, and Artie had to go back to bed and
wait till daylight for further excitement.</p>

<p>Just as soon as it was light, Artie and Polly
were downstairs to examine their stockings.
Whoever had filled them, knew exactly how the
job should be done and Ward and Jess, and
Margy and Fred, had the same report to make.</p>

<p>There were the red beads Polly wanted in
the toe of hers; packed in among the candy and
nuts in his, Artie found the jackknife he had
long coveted; Ward, who had once said he
never had enough to eat, was delighted with
a stocking stuffed from toe to top with nothing
but food of one sort or another; Jess found a new
pair of gloves rolled up in hers, to take the place
of the missing one. Margy had beads, too, only
hers were blue; and Fred had a fountain pen with
his initials on it in gold.</p>

<p>After the stockings came breakfast, and then it
was time to see the larger presents. Later, Polly
and Artie went to the Williamsons and helped
Fred and Margy try on their new skates, then
the four went to the Larues to help Jess and
Ward admire the two new sleds, and then they all
went back to the Marley house where Polly and
Artie displayed a jumble of new skates, sweaters
and muff and games and books that made one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
wonder what these children would have left to
wish for another Christmas.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go to the post-office,” said Polly.
“The mail is in now.”</p>

<p>And it was, a delightfully exciting mail which
held cards and letters and packages for every one
in the three families, from cousins and aunts and
uncles who lived far away.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” gasped Artie, when the packages
were sorted out and he had his in his arms.
“Look! Here’s something from Mr. Kirby!”</p>

<p>Well, there was a package for each member of
the Riddle Club from Mr. Kirby. They knew
he had sent them, for his name and address were
on the outside wrapper. Each box was exactly
alike in shape and size. What <i>could</i> be in them?</p>

<p>“Let’s open them,” said Artie, sensibly.</p>

<p>There were a number of wrappers, and from
the last one tumbled a small white box and a
card that read, “With best Christmas wishes to
Artie Marley, from his friends, Tony Kirby and
Will Adams.”</p>

<p>Each card said the same thing, substituting the
various names of the Riddle Club members.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” cried Polly, the moment
she had opened her box. “How perfectly
lovely!”</p>

<p>The little box was lined with blue velvet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
on the blue velvet lay a gold signet ring. There
were two letters engraved on the face. They
were R.C. Polly lifted out the ring and turned
it over. Inside it was engraved with her name
and the date.</p>

<p>“And they fit!” said Margy, in surprise, as
six rings were slipped on six fingers. “He must
have asked our mothers what size we wear!”</p>

<p>And that was exactly what Mr. Kirby had done.
He had written to find out what ring sizes to
order, and the three mothers had kept his secret
carefully.</p>

<p>“He gave us our lovely club pins, and now we
have club rings,” said Polly. “I never knew any
one so nice!”</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry and write him a letter right away,
and Mrs. Williamson can take it to-morrow,”
suggested Artie.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Williamson were supposed to
spend New Year’s with the Kirbys in Rye, because
they had not gone at Thanksgiving time. But
Mrs. Williamson had discovered that she couldn’t
go away from home for New Year’s Day, and
now they were to leave the next day and have a
little visit during holiday week. Fred and
Margy were to stay with the Marleys while their
parents were away.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Mr. and Mrs. Williamson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
set off for Rye, they carried a letter
signed by all the Riddle Club members, thanking
Mr. Kirby and Mr. Adams for their gifts
and telling them how much happiness they had
given.</p>

<p>“Gee, isn’t it cold,” said Fred, as the Williamson
automobile disappeared around the turn in
Elm Road. “I’ll bet you it is thirty degrees below
zero.”</p>

<p>Mr. Larue overheard him and laughed.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be standing there so complacently,
Fred, if it were as cold as that,” he said.
“This is just good skating weather.”</p>

<p>It was so cold and clear that Jess declared she
saw “miles and miles” when she looked across
the river, now frozen over. The ground was
covered with snow, of course, and at every step
this crunched under foot. When a wagon went
past the wheels screeched, a sure sign of a cold
day.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it great!” bubbled Ward. “We have
new skates and there’ll be skating as soon as they
get the river swept off; there isn’t any school, so
we can have all the fun we want; and there’s
good coasting, too, and some of us have new
sleds. And I haven’t eaten all my candy up,
either,” he added.</p>

<p>“You’re one satisfied person,” commented Fred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
blinking, for the sun on the snow was dazzling.
“Let’s go down and watch them sweep off the
river. Maybe they won’t let us on yet.”</p>

<p>But “they” were willing for River Bend folk
to go skating, for the ice was firm and thick.
Later it would be cut to fill ice-houses, but as a
rule the children could count on good skating
through January. A group of men were busily
at work this morning, with brooms, brushes and
horse-drawn scrapers, taking the snow off the
ice and getting it ready for the skaters. The sun
was helping, too, and the Riddle Club members
decided that by noon the river would be in fine
condition.</p>

<p>“We’re going up to the pond, Mother,” said
Polly, at the lunch table. “No, we’ll not be cold.
You never get cold skating.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be late for supper,” cautioned Mrs.
Marley. “And be sure you are dressed warmly.
It will be much colder toward night.”</p>

<p>“It’s cold enough now,” grumbled Margy, who
would have liked to go skating in July, if that had
been possible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>ANOTHER RACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Margy refused to be enthusiastic
about cold weather, nothing would induce her to
miss a skating party. She could skate well, as
indeed could nearly every child in River Bend.
With a river at hand, it would have been strange
if they had failed to learn as soon as they could
buckle on their skates. The Riddle Club members
could hardly remember the time when they
had not gone skating.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it have been a shame,” said Fred,
striking off up the ice with long, even swings, “if
the first skating of the year had come while we
had to go to school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would,” agreed Ward. “I think they
ought to cut out school in the winter, anyway. I
don’t mind it so much in March, because half the
time it rains and you can’t have much fun in the
rain; but winter is the best time of year to be outdoors.”</p>

<p>Ward looked as though he was thoroughly enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
himself. He was puffing slightly—he
couldn’t help getting out of breath when he exercised—but
his eyes were beaming and he
showed his even, white teeth in a delighted grin.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s as cold as it was,” said Jess
to Polly.</p>

<p>“That’s because you’ve warmed up,” declared
Polly wisely. “I’m never cold when I’m skating.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, it is warmer,” insisted Jess.</p>

<p>“Sure it is,” Fred flung over his shoulder.
“It’s turned warmer since we came out.”</p>

<p>Though Polly had announced that they were
going up to the pond, they did not start right
away. The river was fairly well covered with
skaters by this time, and presently a string of
skaters appeared, seven boys and seven girls, each
wearing a white woolly sweater with a large
“C.C.” stitched across the front.</p>

<p>“Look at the Conundrum Club!” cried Polly.
“They have sweaters just alike. Do you suppose
they’re Christmas presents?”</p>

<p>The sweaters were Christmas gifts. Carrie
herself told Polly, when she skated up a few
minutes later and asked to see the Riddle Club
rings.</p>

<p>“How did you know we had rings?” Polly
asked, surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Oh, some girl told me,” said Carrie. “I suppose
they’re plated. But the monogram is kind
of nice, only I think signet rings are rather old
fashioned, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Polly wanted to laugh, for Carrie was trying
the ring on as she spoke. Carrie seldom praised
another’s possessions, but it was easy to see that
she admired the new ring.</p>

<p>“I say, Fred,” called Joe Anderson, skating
up, “let’s have a race. Bet you I can beat you to
the bend and back.”</p>

<p>Margy pulled violently on Fred’s sweater.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it,” she whispered. “He cheats!
Remember the time you coasted?”</p>

<p>Fred did remember, but a challenge was a challenge.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll race you,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we all race?” asked Carrie, shrilly.
“Let’s make it a Conundrum Club against the
Riddle Club race.”</p>

<p>“Go on—that will be fun!” cried some of the
other boys and girls skating about the circle.
“And the winners have to race again.”</p>

<p>That was the way it was finally decided—that
six of the Conundrum Club members should race
the members of the Riddle Club. Joe Anderson
chose the ones he wanted to represent the Conundrum
Club—besides himself and Carrie, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
were Mattie Helms, Albert Holmes, Ben Asher
and Stella Dorman.</p>

<p>“We’ll line up and start when Edith counts
three,” said Joe, who, having planned the race, did
not seem to think he was obliged, as a matter of
courtesy, to consult the wishes of any one else.</p>

<p>Edith Spencer was a member of the Conundrum
Club. She was a girl who easily became
excited, and the first time she tried to count three
she stuttered so badly that no one could tell what
she was trying to say. The second time she did
better and at the word “Three!” the skaters
dashed off, Joe Anderson in the lead.</p>

<p>“I wish I was bigger!” thought Artie, skating
bravely. “I’d like to win—but just the same if
I can’t beat that Albert Holmes, I’d like to know
the reason!”</p>

<p>The bend in the river had been designated as
the turning point, and Joe Anderson reached it
first, with Fred close behind him. Fred was saving
his speed for the spurt he wanted to make on
the return way. Polly was ahead of Carrie and
Mattie had just passed Margy when Jess
stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” she cried, as Ward and Artie
came up with her. “Go on! Hurry!”</p>

<p>But Ward and Artie pulled her to her feet,
and then the three tried desperately to regain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
ground lost. It was too much of a handicap,
however, and Albert Holmes and Ben Asher both
came in ahead of Artie, who had set his heart on
beating Albert.</p>

<p>It was almost a tie between Fred and Joe, and
Polly was a half yard ahead of Carrie, so another
race was planned between these four.</p>

<p>Fred had a plan all his own which he hoped
would work. He had carefully refrained from
fast skating in the first race, being contented to
keep up with Joe. He knew that the second race
would be harder, because he would not be as
fresh. This time he was determined to skate at
top speed.</p>

<p>At the signal they started, Polly in the lead.
A flash passed her; it was Fred, head bent, eyes
on his skates. Try as he would, Joe could not
pass him, and Fred held his lead to the bend and
back to the starting point, winning by a good yard.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, Carrie beat Polly,” said Stella
Dorman, as Carrie shot in ahead of Polly, who
had lost time in making the turn. “No one can
say the Riddle Club skaters are better than we
are.”</p>

<p>Fred was satisfied to have it that way.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’re going somewhere,” he said,
beckoning to his chums. “Race you again some
time, Joe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>The Riddle Club waved good-bye and went on
up the river. They skated more slowly now, for
they were just a little tired from the excitement
and the fast skating. Polly’s cheeks were crimson
and Ward was panting.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down a minute,” suggested Jess. “I
want to see if I skinned my knee when I fell
down.”</p>

<p>They skated into the shore and sat down on the
bank. Jess discovered that her knee was not
badly hurt, after all, and Ward was grateful for
the rest.</p>

<p>“Looks like more snow,” said Fred, pointing
to the sky, now gray and overcast.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be cheerful?” scolded Margy.
“We’ve had all the snow we want for a long
time. It’s going to be clear weather—the paper
said so,” and Margy looked triumphantly at her
brother.</p>

<p>“You have to take the kind of weather you
get,” said Artie, sagely. “It doesn’t make any
difference what you want.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think it’s going to snow,” announced
Polly, rising. “Come on—if we’re going
to Jackson’s Pond, we’d better get there.
We haven’t reached the fork, yet.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p204.jpg" alt="FRED HELD HIS LEAD, WINNING BY A YARD"></div>
<p class="caption">FRED HELD HIS LEAD, WINNING BY A YARD.</p>

<p>To reach the pond, it was necessary to skate
to a point where the river forked. Two miles up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
this arm, one came to Jackson’s Pond, a place
much used for picnics in summer and the scene
of evening skating parties in the winter. It had
long been an ambition of Fred’s to skate all the
way to this pond, because he had always gone by
automobile before.</p>

<p>The children skated steadily and soon reached
the fork where they turned into the narrow “arm”
that lay through a rather desolate country.
There were no houses to be seen, but here and
there smoke drifted from a chimney and indicated
the presence of a farm.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to live up here, would you?”
said Artie.</p>

<p>“No, River Bend is much nicer,” agreed Jess.</p>

<p>“Still, we could skate to school if we lived
here,” suggested Polly. “That must be the
schoolhouse over there.”</p>

<p>She pointed to a small building set in a fenced
yard. There was a flag pole, but no flag was
flying.</p>

<p>“Closed for the holidays,” commented Fred.
“There! Who said it wasn’t going to snow?”
he added triumphantly.</p>

<p>A stinging wet flake struck Margy’s upturned
face.</p>

<p>“It’s just a flurry,” she said comfortably.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’d better turn around and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
back,” said Polly. “We’ll be skating against the
wind, anyway, and it will take us longer to get
home than it has to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, we want to be able to say we’ve
skated as far as the pond,” urged Fred. “You’re
not afraid of a little snow, are you, Polly?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not, but I don’t want to be caught
in a big storm, miles away from any house,” said
Polly, sensibly.</p>

<p>“This won’t be a big storm,” declared Artie.</p>

<p>But the snow continued to come faster and the
wind rose, growling.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s late?” said Margy, suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, it can’t be,” answered Fred. “We
started right after lunch, and it was only half-past
twelve.”</p>

<p>A sudden gust of wind struck Margy sharply
in the face.</p>

<p>“It’s so dark!” she gasped, swallowing a
mouthful of snow.</p>

<p>And it was dark. The clouds were heavy and
they seemed so near that Jess was sure she could
touch them. The wind had risen steadily, and
as the six children rounded a bend in the stream,
it caught them full force.</p>

<p>“I can’t breathe!” screamed Jess, in a sudden
panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Turn around!” shouted Fred.</p>

<p>They turned their backs to the storm and
waited a moment.</p>

<p>“There’s no use trying to go back,” cried Fred
to Polly, as another gust of wind swooped upon
them. “It’s blowing from all directions at once.
We’d better try to get in somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Is it a blizzard?” asked Jess.</p>

<p>“It’s a storm,” said Fred, trying to speak
cheerfully. “Come on, we’ll take off our skates
and walk. There’s no use trying to skate in a
wind like this.”</p>

<p>They managed to get their skates off, and then
climbed the low bank.</p>

<p>“We’ll follow the river,” Fred decided, “because
if we get back in the country we might get
lost.”</p>

<p>Fred was a very comforting person to have
around when things didn’t go right, Polly thought,
trudging after him. He could always think of
something to do, and his plans were usually good.
Instead of being undecided, or standing around
in the teeth of the wind while he thought of what
they should do, he kept them moving, and moving
was so much better than standing still. You
felt as though you were going toward help, at
least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Do you see anything over there, Ward?” Fred
shouted, suddenly, breaking in on Polly’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Where?” cried Ward, peering through the
whirling film of snow.</p>

<p>“There—across the river,” answered Fred,
pointing.</p>

<p>Ward stared. Yes, the dim outlines of a building
certainly could be seen.</p>

<p>“It’s a house!” shouted Fred. “We’ll have
to cross over.”</p>

<p>“I hope they have some kind of a fire. I’m
almost frozen stiff!” muttered Margy.</p>

<small>CAUGHT IN A STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys helped the three girls down the bank
and, slipping and sliding, they made their way
across the river to the other side. Scrambling
up this bank, they found the building was further
back than they had supposed.</p>

<p>“I’m so co-old!” shivered Margy. “I don’t
see any smoke coming out of a chimney. I don’t
believe any one lives there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any chimney,” declared Ward,
trying to brush the snow away from before his
face so that he could see clearly—a hopeless task.</p>

<p>“Well, some one must live there,” said Fred,
impatiently. “Hurry up, or we’ll freeze standing
here.”</p>

<p>It was dark now, and they were stiff and tired.
Their clothes were damp and their gloves soaked
through. Worse still, they were hungry, and
Artie, who had often sighed to be an explorer, began
to wonder whether he was going to starve to
death in the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Fred led the way toward the building and the
others followed him, longing for the sight of a
bright fire and a lighted lamp. The ground was
humpy, and Margy began to cry when she fell
down.</p>

<p>“I’m so tired,” she sniffed, as Polly pulled her
up. “If any one lives in that house they’re not
at home, because it’s dark.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there’s a light at the back,” said
Fred. “Maybe they only have a light in the
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think, Fred?” called
Polly, raising her voice above the wind which
still buffeted them unmercifully. “I think that is
a barn! It doesn’t look like a house to me.”</p>

<p>“If it’s a barn, that means there’s a house
near here,” shouted Fred. “That’s good luck.”</p>

<p>But when they had reached the barn—for it
was a barn, after all—another disappointment
awaited them. The building was open on both
sides, and the wind swept through the wide doorways
and hurled the snow into the corners, where
it lay in heaps.</p>

<p>The barn was an old one, evidently abandoned
years before!</p>

<p>“Come on in,” said Fred, refusing to be discouraged.
“It can’t be as cold as it is outside.
And because the barn isn’t used is no sign there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
isn’t a house near. There must be a house!”</p>

<p>The six forlorn chums stepped inside the dark
doorway and found themselves in a cavern, or
so it seemed to them.</p>

<p>“Be careful,” warned Polly. “Some of the
boards may be rotten and we might step through
them, or fall into a hole.”</p>

<p>They felt their way carefully, following the
wall, till they were well back from the doorway
through which they had entered. Protected in
a measure from the wind, they felt warmer at
once.</p>

<p>“You stand still,” commanded Fred. “I’m going
over to that other doorway and look out.”</p>

<p>He felt his way around slowly, and when he
felt the wind blow full in his face he knew he had
reached the other doorway.</p>

<p>“Say, I see a light!” he called to the others.
“A little light, and that must be in a house. It
looks a mile away, but I’ll bet you it is a house.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go another step,” declared Margy,
sitting down on the floor. “Not another step.
I’m too tired to move.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll freeze here,” said Polly. “Won’t
she, Fred?”</p>

<p>“I’d just as lief freeze as to break my leg walking
over that humpy ground again,” retorted
Margy, bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Well, I’d rather stay here, too,” announced
Jess. “You don’t know positively that that light
is in a house. And if it is in a house, it may be
miles and miles away. I’d rather stay here till
morning.”</p>

<p>They were all so tired and cold that a quarrel
might easily have developed, had not Polly proposed
a plan.</p>

<p>“I tell you what let’s do,” she said good-temperedly.
“Let Jess and Margy stay here and
Ward and Artie take care of them; then I’ll go
with you, Fred, and we’ll see if that light is in
a house. Perhaps we’ll find the house that goes
with this barn first, and that will be nearer.”</p>

<p>Ward and Artie wanted to go with Polly and
Fred, but were finally persuaded to remain with
the two girls.</p>

<p>“Don’t stay all night,” begged Artie, as Polly
whispered to him to be good and not let Margy
get frightened.</p>

<p>“Say, Polly, you’re all right,” Fred told her,
striking off in the direction of the twinkling light.
“I know you’re dead tired and cold, too, but you
don’t grunt. Uh!” and Fred gave a grunt himself.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Polly, anxiously.
“What is it, Fred?”</p>

<p>“I walked into something,” said Fred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
“Nearly knocked my teeth out. Don’t know
what it is, but it feels like a tower of some sort.”</p>

<p>“I know,” cried Polly, feeling the “tower.”
“It’s one of the brick foundations of a porch,
Fred. Feel the loose bricks under the snow?
This is probably where the house that goes with
that old barn stood, and it either burned down
or fell down.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” said Fred. “See, here’s
the cellar. I won’t grumble because I walked
into that column of bricks—if I hadn’t we might
have both stepped into that cellar, and that
wouldn’t have been any fun.”</p>

<p>Carefully and feeling each step of the way,
they skirted the open cellar. The wind and the
snow made going very slow, and the twinkling
light seemed to come no nearer.</p>

<p>“Want to stop and get your breath, Polly?”
asked Fred, a little anxiously, when they had been
walking some minutes in silence.</p>

<p>“I’m—all—right,” gasped Polly. “But I’ve
got my scarf tied over my mouth to keep the wind
out. I can’t talk.”</p>

<p>They plodded on after that, and to Fred’s delight
the light came nearer and nearer at last.
Soon they could see that it shone from the window
of a house and streamed feebly out on a
broken picket fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“At least they’re at home,” said Fred, thankfully.
“You can stay and get warm, Polly, and
I’ll go back and get the others.”</p>

<p>He was sure their troubles were over, and he
rapped loudly on the door with visions of a hot
supper dancing before his eyes.</p>

<p>No one answered his knock, and he rapped
again. Still silence.</p>

<p>“We’ll both knock,” said Polly, and the two
of them beat a tattoo on the door.</p>

<p>“Some one’s coming,” whispered Polly.
“Hark!”</p>

<p>They heard a bolt drawn back and a key in
the lock turned. Then the door opened slowly
and an old woman peered out.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” she asked. “What do you
want?”</p>

<p>“Please, we’re caught in the storm,” said Polly.
“May we come in and get warm?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re children!” said the old woman,
in astonishment. “Come in—come in. Though
you can’t get warm, I’m thinking. I got out of
bed to answer your knock, and there’s no wood
in the house to make a fire.”</p>

<p>She opened the door wider and beckoned them
to come in. They saw a square room, neatly
furnished and evidently used as a combination
sitting room and kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“You must be chilled through,” said the old
woman. “I can fix a fire for you, if this boy will
go out to the woodshed and get some wood;
there’s plenty cut there, but I couldn’t go out in
the storm. My rheumatism took me this afternoon,
and I had to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“There are four more of us, waiting in a barn,”
explained Polly, as Fred went out to find the
woodshed, carrying a lantern the old woman gave
him. “We were out skating this afternoon and
lost our way.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, you must be hungry, too! Now,
if you could cook, there’s eggs in that bowl on the
shelf and bread and butter and jam a-plenty. I
have cold baked beans left over, too.”</p>

<p>The old woman could hardly walk, and Polly
said at once that she would cook the eggs.</p>

<p>“Then let your brother build up a good fire and
put a kettle of water on to heat, and you set the
table and get the supper ready. I’ll tell you
where to find things. I declare, I feel better already,
having some one to talk to. And that fire
feels good, too. I won’t be caught this way
again; I’ll fill up my woodbox when I have a
chance, and then when I’m flat on my back I won’t
have to worry.”</p>

<p>Fred built a roaring fire in the stove, filled the
woodbox, and then, not stopping to dry his gloves—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
say nothing of his shoes, which were soaked
through—he set off to the barn to bring the rest
back with him.</p>

<p>While he was gone, Polly first made some tea
and boiled an egg for their kind hostess. Then
she set the table at the old woman’s directions,
told her who they were and explained about the
Riddle Club and that Fred was not her brother.
She cut the bread and scrambled the eggs, and
when Fred and the others returned they found a
cheerful picture awaiting them—a warm kitchen
and a table set with six bowls of milk and a mound
of bread already buttered, not to mention a pan
of baked beans, the reddest of red currant jam,
and the yellowest of golden eggs sizzling in a pan
on the stove.</p>

<p>“Take off your wet things,” ordered the old
woman. “I guess I have enough bedroom slippers
to go round. I have ten nieces, and every
blessed one of them has, at some time or other,
knit me a pair of bedroom slippers. They don’t
seem to think I wear anything else.”</p>

<p>The girls and boys laughed, but when they had
taken off their heavy, wet shoes, the red and pink
and blue and purple wool knitted slippers felt very
cozy and warm to their tired feet. Their gloves
and mittens were hung on a line behind the stove
and the shoes arranged in a row on the hearth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and then they sat down to enjoy their belated
supper.</p>

<p>“I suppose your folks will be worried to death
about you, but we can’t help it,” said the old woman.
Her name, she told them, was Mrs. Wicks.
“There’s a telephone in a house about half a mile
away, but a storm like this always breaks down
the wires, even if you were fit to go out again to-night,
which you’re not. I never saw a storm
come up quicker than this one did, and it’s lucky
for me you came along. I haven’t a fancy to
have a rheumatic attack and no wood for a fire
in the house.”</p>

<p>Artie and Ward went to sleep at the table,
and that brought up the question of where they
were to sleep.</p>

<p>“I’ve got two bedrooms, besides mine,” said
Mrs. Wicks. “But they haven’t been used this
winter. I’m afraid they’re damp.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right,” said Polly, politely.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t be all right,” declared Mrs.
Wicks, with vigor. “I don’t aim to have you
take cold, sleeping in damp sheets. I can’t get
the things out, but you go in and bring the
sheets and blankets off those two beds and
hang ’em on chairs before the fire; that will dry
them. You can put the two little fellows on
my bed till theirs is ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>But neither Polly nor Fred would hear to this,
so Artie and Ward were finally shaken awake
and set to work carrying out blankets while the
girls washed the dishes. Mrs. Wicks had had
a nap before their arrival, and she was enjoying
herself, but Polly and Margy confided to
each other that never, never, never had they
been half so tired and sleepy.</p>

<p>Finally the blankets and sheets were pronounced
dry, the beds made up again, and, leaning
on Fred and Polly, Mrs. Wicks hobbled
to her own room. In two minutes after they
had lain down, the six members of the Riddle
Club were fast asleep, and though the wind
howled all night and shook the windows and
rattled loose shutters, not a sound did they
hear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>MRS. WICKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> was the first to wake in the morning.
She opened one eye sleepily, saw her dress hanging
over a chair back, caught a glimpse of unfamiliar
wall paper on the side of the room, and
sat up with a jerk.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jess, drowsily.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Polly. “I remember now. We’re
here. Say, Jess, it must be late; the sun is
shining.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s stopped snowing,” said Jess. “We
can go home. Let’s get dressed in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Margy woke up, and it did not take the three
girls long to dress, for they had slept in their
underclothes, having removed only their dresses
and stockings.</p>

<p>Polly peeped out into the kitchen and saw Fred
pumping water at the sink.</p>

<p>“Want to wash your face?” he whispered.
“Here’s a towel. It’s stopped snowing, but you
ought to see the snow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>Polly stood on tiptoe to glance out of the window
over the sink. The sun was dazzling, and
trees and fences and outbuildings were plastered
with drifts of snow, flung against them by the
wind.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty!” cried Polly, in delight.</p>

<p>“It won’t be so pretty to walk home,” said
Ward, who joined them.</p>

<p>“Are you children up?” called Mrs. Wicks.
“I wish one of you girls would help me get
dressed. My knee isn’t any worse, but then it
isn’t any better.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help her,” offered Margy, hastily. “You
build the fire, Fred, because it’s freezing cold in
this kitchen.”</p>

<p>Fred and Artie went out to get more wood, for
Fred suggested that they leave the woodbox untouched,
and Margy went to help the old woman
get dressed.</p>

<p>By the time she was ready, the kitchen was
warm and Polly and Jess set the breakfast table,
while Mrs. Wicks stirred up griddle cakes and
showed them how to make oatmeal.</p>

<p>“The man on the next farm always brings me
milk,” the old lady explained, “and it shows how
deep the snow must be, if he can’t get here. It’s
lucky I have some milk left from yesterday.”</p>

<p>They had a cheerful breakfast, and when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
was over Polly asked if there wasn’t something
they could do to help.</p>

<p>“We can’t walk home through the snow while
it is as deep as this,” she said sensibly, “and perhaps
we can help you, if you’ll tell us how.
What would you do if you weren’t lame this
morning?”</p>

<p>“I’d feed my chickens and shovel some paths
around the house and down to the mail-box,” said
Mrs. Wicks, promptly. “Then I’d sit down and
sew.”</p>

<p>Fred and Artie and Ward said they could do
the outdoor work, and they went at it with a will.
Though before that they found that their shoes
were so stiff it wasn’t easy to get them on. But
Mrs. Wicks brought out some grease and showed
them how to rub it in, and that made the leather
pliable again. Fred did the girls’ shoes for them,
and Margy was especially grateful, for she loved
to be comfortable and she had been dreading to
put on her stiffened shoes.</p>

<p>The three girls washed and dried the dishes,
swept and straightened up the kitchen, made the
beds and watered the geranium that Mrs. Wicks
said couldn’t be killed, for no matter how cold
the kitchen was, it lived, winter after winter, if
protected by a paper at night.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come and live with me all winter,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the old lady said, when Ward brought in
six eggs he had found in the henhouse and Fred
and Artie reported that a path had been swept
out to the mail-box. “I like company. One of
my nieces comes to stay with me part of the time,
and she’s coming the day after New Year’s. But
she isn’t young like you.”</p>

<p>Fred asked about the barn in which they had
stayed, and Mrs. Wicks told them that the place
had once been a prosperous farm.</p>

<p>“The house burned down one summer, and
the people farmed it for a time, living in the barn
and using it as a house,” she said. “Then they
sold the place and moved away, and the new
owner never did anything with it. One by one
the outbuildings fell to pieces, and they say one
good wind will blow the barn over, if it gets it in
the right corner.”</p>

<p>“There’s rats in it!” shuddered Margy. “I
was sitting on the floor last night, waiting for
Fred to come back, and a horrid rat ran right
across my lap!”</p>

<p>“She let out a yell that could be heard in River
Bend,” said Ward, grinning. “And then she
rushed outdoors and wouldn’t come back. Fred
found her standing in the snow, crying.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d cry, too, if a rat ran over me,” said
Jess, stoutly. “Ugly, horrid things!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Mrs. Wicks got out her box of patchwork and
showed the gay-colored patches to her visitors.
Like many lonely old ladies, she was fond of telling
stories about her girlhood, and with a brand
new audience the temptation was too great to
be resisted.</p>

<p>“You girls don’t sew patchwork nowadays, do
you?” she asked, smiling.</p>

<p>“We can knit,” offered Polly, apologetically.
“But none of us ever made a quilt. My grandmother
did, when she was a little girl, though.”</p>

<p>“Ward speaking of the rat that frightened
Margy, reminded me of a scare I had when I was
a little girl,” said Mrs. Wicks.</p>

<p>“I had gone to visit my Aunt Deborah, of
whom I was very fond. Aunt had a son, about
sixteen—I was then eleven—and, dear me, what a
tease Coburn was! He called me ‘Miss Prim’
and pulled my hair whenever he had a chance.
I was supposed to sew on my patchwork every
afternoon, even when visiting, and Coburn
thought that a girl cousin who spent hours sewing
wasn’t much fun to have around. He would
have liked me to be a boy cousin and climb trees
with him.”</p>

<p>“But we girls climb trees!” put in Jess. But
Mrs. Wicks paid no attention to the remark, and
went on with her story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Well, I was sitting quietly with my little sewing
basket one afternoon, in the parlor window.
Aunt Deborah kept the parlor tightly closed most
of the time, and there must have been some special
reason why I was allowed to sit there and sew,
but I don’t recall it. Perhaps because I was company.
The parlor window overlooked the road,
and, girl-like, I was interested in the various
teams that drove past. I liked to see what people
were doing as much as any one. Coburn wasn’t
anywhere around, and Aunt Deborah was still upstairs
finishing her nap.</p>

<p>“A spic and span, shiny new buggy went past
with a girl dressed in white driving, and I leaned
forward to look, at the same time putting out my
hand to take a spool of thread from the basket.
I felt something move under my hand, but I
thought it was the spool of thread rolling from
my fingers. Unconsciously I took a firmer clutch,
and something squeaked. I had picked up a little
white mouse!”</p>

<p>“Ugh! How awful! Didn’t you scream?”
asked Margy.</p>

<p>“Scream! I should think I did!” returned
Mrs. Wicks, smiling at the recollection. “To my
startled eyes that basket seemed alive with white
mice, and I threw it across the room in one direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
and my patchwork and thimble in another.
Then I fled, still screaming.</p>

<p>“Aunt Deborah came downstairs on the run,
and Coburn mysteriously appeared from some
secret place. He caught me as I came rushing
out of the door and, with some difficulty, calmed
me. I think he was a little frightened, for I
couldn’t stop crying at first and nothing would
induce me to go into the parlor or touch my work
basket again. Aunt Deborah made Coburn pick
up the scattered spools and put the basket in order.
As for his three pet mice, no one ever
knew what became of them—they may have
run off to live with their relations. Anyway,
they never came back and Aunt Deborah declared
it served Coburn right for playing such a
trick.”</p>

<p>Margy said that she thought mice were the
worst animals that ever lived, except rats, while
Fred contended that mice were all right when you
knew them. This started an argument that
lasted till Mrs. Wicks suggested they go down
to the mail-box and see if the postman had got
through the drifts.</p>

<p>“If we’d only brought our sleds, instead of the
skates, we could get home,” said Ward.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t snowing when we left,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Polly. “Oh, dear, I do hope the folks aren’t
worrying about us.”</p>

<p>“If we had some snowshoes, we could walk
home, on top of the snow,” said Artie. “Why
couldn’t we make some?”</p>

<p>“Out of what?” asked Fred, promptly.</p>

<p>“Barrel staves,” replied Artie.</p>

<p>“I think stilts would be better,” declared Ward.
“Stilts would hold us up, out of the drifts.”</p>

<p>“Snowshoes are what we need,” decreed Fred.
“Perhaps we could make them out of barrels.
Let’s see if Mrs. Wicks has any barrels she
doesn’t want.”</p>

<p>“Barrels?” said Mrs. Wicks, when they asked
her. “Oh, my, yes! plenty of barrels out in the
woodshed. Do anything you like with them.”</p>

<p>With the three girls as interested, if not hopeful,
spectators (Polly was sure she couldn’t walk
on snowshoes after they were made and Margy
said frankly she didn’t think they would ever be
made) the boys ripped two barrels apart and
sandpapered the staves. The sandpaper was
worn pretty smooth—it was all Mrs. Wicks had—and
the staves were remarkably rough, but they
did the best they could.</p>

<p>“You try them first, Fred,” suggested Artie.
“How are you going to keep these snowshoes
on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Skate straps,” said Fred, briefly.</p>

<p>He managed to strap a stave to each of his
feet, using his skate straps, and then, slowly and
gingerly, stepped out of the woodshed.</p>

<p>“The way to walk on snowshoes,” he announced,
“is not to lift your feet and put ’em
down again. You glide along.”</p>

<p>“All right, let’s see you glide,” said Artie,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Fred struck out with what he fondly believed
to be a gliding motion. He sunk one foot deeply
into the snow, balanced there a precarious moment
with his other foot waving wildly in the air
and then crashed over into a handy drift.</p>

<p>“Of course there’s a knack in getting used to
them,” he gasped, as the others pulled him out.
“I’ll get it after a while.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I have to walk on those things to
get home, I’m going to stay here,” said Jess.</p>

<p>“There’s the postman!” cried Margy. “Look,
he’s putting something in the box!”</p>

<p>They ran down the path they had shoveled,
Fred discarding his “snowshoes” as hindrances,
and found the postman to be a jolly person
wrapped in many mufflers and driving a large
white horse harnessed to an old-fashioned sleigh.</p>

<p>“Say, there’s some one looking for you kids,”
he said, as soon as he saw the children. “I met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
a team about a mile back, two men in a sleigh.
They asked me if I’d seen anything of three boys
and three girls. And then I hadn’t, and told
them so.”</p>

<p>“Daddy!” cried Polly. “It must be Daddy
and Mr. Larue. Whereabouts did you see them?”</p>

<p>“They were following this road,” said the postman.
“Looks like them coming now. I’ve had
to make so many stops I guess they’ve caught up
with me. Yes, they’re waving to you. See
’em?”</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children needed no snowshoes to lend
them speed as they ran down the road. Driving
toward them were Mr. Marley and Mr. Larue
in a sleigh drawn by a horse Fred recognized as
“Old Tom,” one of Mr. Davis’s horses.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly have upset the family,”
said Mr. Marley, as Artie hurled himself into
his lap and the others tried to find a place on
the runners.</p>

<p>“Did Mother worry?” asked Polly, anxiously.
“We were all right, only we couldn’t get home.”</p>

<p>“Of course we worried,” answered Mr. Marley.
“I don’t think any one has had a wink of
sleep all night. We went up the river as far as
Jackson’s Pond, hunting for you, but the wind
forced us to give up there.”</p>

<p>“Where did you spend the night?” asked Mr.
Larue, his arm around Jess.</p>

<p>“Oh, we stayed at Mrs. Wicks’ house,” said
Ward, cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“And who is Mrs. Wicks?” asked Mr. Larue,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“She’s an old lady—she lives there,” said Polly,
pointing to the house. “She had rheumatism in
her knee, but she told us what to do and we had
good things to eat and everything was lovely.”</p>

<p>“Except staying in the barn,” amended Margy.
“A rat ran over me, Mr. Marley.”</p>

<p>“We’ll drive on to Mrs. Wicks’ house,” said
Mr. Marley, “and thank her for her kindness.
I don’t suppose she has a telephone, and if she
had, the wires would probably be down. I’d like
to tell the worried mothers that we have found
you, safe and sound.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wicks hobbled to the door to greet her
visitors. She seemed delighted to have more
company, and she would not hear of their starting
back before she had cooked dinner for them.</p>

<p>Mr. Marley and Mr. Larue knew that she
spoke wisely. The roads were badly drifted and,
in spite of the sunshine, it was bitingly cold. If
they had dinner before they started, the ride
would be much more comfortable for them all.</p>

<p>So they said they would stay, and Mrs. Wicks
hobbled about, delighted to have what she called
“a full table.”</p>

<p>“It’s something like!” she said, when they sat
down three-quarters of an hour later to a steaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
hot dinner. “Something like, to have nine
at the table.”</p>

<p>While the girls helped her with the dishes—for
anxious as the fathers were to start home they
would not leave the old lady with all the extra
work to do alone—the boys carried in a great pile
of wood, filling the woodbox to overflowing and
stacking the sticks on the floor beside it. They
fed and watered the chickens, so that a trip out
to the henhouse that night would be unnecessary,
saw that the lamps were filled, went down to the
road to get the milk the neighboring farmer finally
brought, and so left Mrs. Wicks assured of a
comfortable night.</p>

<p>“We could have brought her home with us, I
suppose,” said Mr. Marley, as he tucked the children
in under the heavy robes, “but she wouldn’t
be happy away from her own home. And she
says her niece is coming in a few days to stay with
her for the rest of the winter. But we mustn’t
forget her. We’ll have to come and see her,
often.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t poor, is she, Daddy?” asked Polly,
thoughtfully, cuddling up to the heated brick Mrs.
Wicks had given her.</p>

<p>The old lady had filled the bottom of the
sleigh with hot bricks, wrapped in burlap. They
were as good as stoves, the children declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“No, Mrs. Wicks isn’t poor—not what we call
poor,” answered Mr. Marley, who was driving.
“She has money enough to live on and owns her
house, she tells me. But she is lonely, and sometimes
people need friends more than they need
money.”</p>

<p>The dazzling sunshine made the fields and
laden trees very beautiful to see, but there was a
cold wind, and the snow seemed to have melted
very little. For some distance the traveling was
fairly good, for the postman’s sleigh had broken
the road, but when they turned into another road,
unbroken drifts confronted them.</p>

<p>“This ought to save us a mile, so I think it’s
worth trying,” said Mr. Marley, as the horse
began to flounder. “The way we came was the
longer, but we were following the river to find
the children.”</p>

<p>Old Tom didn’t care if the road was a shorter
one. He didn’t like the big drifts, and he saw
no reason why he should pretend he did. He
shook his head and snorted and finally stood still.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get out and encourage him,”
said Mr. Larue, cheerfully. “You stay in, Marley,
and the boys and I will show old Tom how
easy it is to wade through snow, if you make up
your mind it can be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Mr. Larue got out and the six chums tumbled
after him. The girls begged to help, too, for
they were cramped from sitting under the robes.
The sleigh was pretty well filled when they were
all in it.</p>

<p>“Gee, it is deep, isn’t it!” exclaimed Artie, as
he went in to his waist. “But look at that bare
spot, over there on the field!”</p>

<p>“That’s what the wind did,” Mr. Larue explained.
“It blew all the drifts over into this
road and left the fields lightly covered.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we drive over the fields then?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“That isn’t such a bad idea, Fred,” called Mr.
Marley, who had overheard. “I’ll see if I can
turn old Tom and get through the ditch.”</p>

<p>“Easy on the turn,” cautioned Mr. Larue.
“The deepest snow is there in the ditch.”</p>

<p>“You’ll tip over!” cried Margy, in alarm.
“Do be careful, Mr. Marley!”</p>

<p>Mr. Marley laughed and promised not to tip
the sleigh over. He turned the horse’s head toward
the ditch and called to him encouragingly.
Old Tom merely shook his ears.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t want to try it,” said Mr. Larue.
“I’ll see if I can lead him. Here, boy, you’re all
right. Come on, that’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Talking soothingly to the horse, Mr. Larue
took hold of the bridle and pulled gently. The
horse pulled also, but the other way.</p>

<p>“He won’t go. Try taking him straight
ahead,” Mr. Marley advised. “Look out, Polly—you’re
standing in the way.”</p>

<p>Polly took a step backward, lost her balance,
and went over full-length into a beautiful snow
bank. Her feet, coming up with such startling
suddenness were too much for old Tom. With a
wild snort he started forward, nearly pulling Mr.
Marley from the seat. Plunging and panting,
the horse plowed ahead, and in a few minutes
had worked his way out of the worst of the
drifts.</p>

<p>“Polly! are you all right?” cried Margy, rushing
to her chum’s rescue.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said Polly, a little uncertainly.
“Where’s the horse and sleigh?” she asked, in
surprise, as Fred and Margy pulled her out and
set her on her feet.</p>

<p>“All right, Polly?” asked Mr. Larue, hurrying
up. “Yes, you seem to be. Well, that certainly
was a novel way to persuade a horse, but
it seems to have given us results.”</p>

<p>Polly had to laugh when she heard that her
tumble had made old Tom change his mind. She
said she wasn’t willing to fall over all the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
of the way home, though; but her father said he
didn’t think it would be necessary.</p>

<p>They climbed into the sleigh again, warm and
rosy from their tramping in the drifts, and old
Tom started off as though he had made up his
mind to do his best without further protest.</p>

<p>This time Mr. Larue drove, for Mr. Marley’s
hands were stiff from the cold. Though old Tom
was willing, they could not drive fast, and before
they reached the stretch of state road that would
take them to River Bend, the heat had gone from
the bricks provided by Mrs. Wicks and Margy
was crying with cold. Polly and Jess were far
from comfortable, but they and the boys were
determined to “stick it out.”</p>

<p>“Say, Larue, these youngsters are purple with
cold,” said Mr. Marley, suddenly. “We’ll have
to stop for a moment and give them some exercise.”</p>

<p>Margy didn’t want to move, but Mr. Marley
lifted her out and put her down in the road.
The rest followed, and Mr. Larue tied old Tom
to a tree.</p>

<p>“Now we have to run,” said Mr. Marley.
“From the sleigh to that big maple tree and back,
six times. No one can beg off, and the sooner
you get through with it, the quicker we’ll be
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Margy’s feet were like lead and Polly was sure
she had no feet at all. The tree was some distance
from the sleigh, and the prospect of running
there and back six times loomed like an impossible
task. However, Mr. Marley started off,
and they could do no less than follow.</p>

<p>“I know my feet are broken off!” thought
Polly, limping along. “I won’t look, but I know
they’re gone. My mother will be sorry if I
come home without any feet.”</p>

<p>Behind her, Margy was still crying, wiping
her eyes on her glove as she tried to run. The
boys kept at it doggedly, their eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>When she had touched the tree three times,
Polly made an interesting discovery—her feet
were where they ought to be, right in her shoes.
Better, they felt comfortable, and even warm.</p>

<p>By the time they had completed the six trips,
every one was in a glow—even Margy was smiling.</p>

<p>“Now another hour, and we’ll be home,” said
Mr. Marley. “Tumble in, children, and we’ll
be home before you know it.”</p>

<p>The state road provided much easier going.
There had been more travel over it since the
storm, and occasionally they passed a sleigh or a
motor truck. But the horse was sadly tired before
they came to River Bend, and they found it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
easy to believe when reports came in from the surrounding
country that the storm had been the
worst, from the point of view of blocking traffic,
that the country had experienced in years.</p>

<p>“Are you frozen? Are you hungry? Where
on earth did you stay all night? Are you sure
you haven’t frozen your ears or your toes?” cried
the two mothers together, flying down the steps
as the sleigh at last drew up before the Marley
house.</p>

<p>And even after they had heard the story and
assured themselves that none of the six had suffered
from hunger or exposure, the mothers
couldn’t rest. They heard the story over and
over again, and Mrs. Marley made her husband
promise to take her to see Mrs. Wicks as soon as
the roads were fairly open. Mrs. Larue said
she would go, too, and long after the children
were in bed they sat up planning the kind of box
they would pack and what they would put in it
to please the old lady.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE LAST OF THE SNOWMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed like another Christmas to the members
of the Riddle Club, the day after their experience
in getting home. Every one was so glad
to see them that they were allowed to please
themselves pretty much, till Ward made himself
sick with too much candy and Margy and Fred
quarreled because they wanted to go skating and
coasting at the same time; that is, each wanted
the other to do his or her way.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s beginning to melt,” Fred reported,
coming into the house for lunch. “Hear it drip!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marley had invited Jess and Ward, and
the six chums were together at the table.</p>

<p>“Thawing!” cried Polly. “It will spoil the
skating.”</p>

<p>“But it will take a lot to spoil the coasting,”
said Artie. “Let’s go this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Williamson were expected back
on New Year’s Day, early in the morning, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Fred and Margy were still staying with the Marleys.</p>

<p>As soon as lunch was over, they got the sleds
out and set off for the hill.</p>

<p>“Gee, when it begins to melt, it sure does
start!” observed Ward.</p>

<p>Little rivers of water were running off the
roofs and householders were out opening the gutters.</p>

<p>“It’s the January thaw,” said Margy, wisely.</p>

<p>“It isn’t January till to-morrow,” retorted Jess.</p>

<p>“Does it always thaw in January?” asked
Artie, athirst for information.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Margy. “Some time in
January it will thaw. Always. Mattie Helms
told me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it thaws some time in every
month,” declared Fred. “Every winter month,
that is,” he added, remembering the changing
seasons.</p>

<p>“Well, this is the January thaw,” insisted
Margy. “It will be January to-morrow, and so
it is really time.”</p>

<p>When they reached the hill, they found a number
of coasters, though it was more slush than
snow. The runners sent up fine streams of water
as the sleds raced down, and in the ditches on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
either side of the road a rushing stream of snow
water was pouring.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s spring,” gasped Jess, as a splash
of water struck her in the face.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll have lots more snow and ice yet,”
said Fred. “But I don’t call this much fun, do
you? Let’s go home and go up in the clubroom.”</p>

<p>They were half-soaked already, and no one
made any objections to returning home. Mrs.
Marley made them take off their wet shoes and
put on dry ones, and then they went upstairs to
play parcheesi in the clubroom.</p>

<p>“There won’t be much left of Riddle Chap
after this,” remarked Polly, happening to glance
from the window while waiting her turn to play.</p>

<p>“Say, he has gone down, hasn’t he?” said Jess,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“He’s wasting away,” giggled Polly. “Poor
old Riddle Chap! But he’s had a pretty long
life for a snowman.”</p>

<p>The poor snowman was visibly melting.
Trickles of water ran over him and he seemed
to be sinking into the ground.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad when he’s gone,” said Jess. “He
brought me bad luck—made me lose my glove.”</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as good luck or bad
luck,” declared Fred. “You lost your glove because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
you didn’t take care of it. Don’t blame
that on poor old Riddle Chap.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you call it bad luck that you lost the
bank?” asked Jess, heedless of Polly’s warning
frown.</p>

<p>“No, of course that wasn’t bad luck,” said
Fred, stoutly. “That was my own fault. I put
it down somewhere, but I’ll never tell you where.
And Dad wanted me to open a savings-bank account
with it, too. I ought to have taken his
advice.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t lost the new bank,” said Artie,
who meant to be comforting.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” agreed Fred. “And that
isn’t good luck, either. It’s good care. I look
at the bank first thing every night and morning,
to make sure it is in the right place.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some one took the other bank,” suggested
Margy.</p>

<p>Fred glanced at her sharply. She was watching
the board and apparently had just said that
without thinking.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how any one could have taken it,”
said Fred, and then it was his turn to play.</p>

<p>He still thought, now and then, that Carrie
Pepper knew more about the bank than she cared
to tell. But Fred had made up his mind not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
say anything until he had more than suspicions
to back him, and he resolutely refused to put his
thought into words.</p>

<p>That night it turned a little colder, as it usually
does, and the melting snow froze in little
lace ruffles on the edges of the roofs. Riddle
Chap had an icicle on what was left of his nose,
and Polly was hopeful that he would stay as he
was and not shrink any more. Alas! New
Year’s Day dawned with a burst of sunlight that
started the little streams running again, turned
the coasting hill to a sea of slush, and hastened
the sure disappearance of the once handsome
Riddle Chap.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we have his picture,” said
Polly, mournfully, at breakfast.</p>

<p>“You can build another snowman, when another
snow comes,” said Mr. Marley, cheerfully.</p>

<p>But Polly said it wouldn’t be Riddle Chap, and
of course no one could deny that.</p>

<p>However, it was impossible to feel sober on
such a bright morning, and “Happy New Year!”
sounded up and down Elm Road as the children
greeted each other. School would open the day
after to-morrow, and they were determined to
have as much fun as possible before the holidays
were definitely over.</p>

<p>Breakfast was barely finished when the Williamson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
car came down the road, bringing Mr.
and Mrs. Williamson back to their home. They
had much to tell about their visit in Rye and messages
from “the old hermit,” as the youngsters
still called Mr. Field, as well as from his sister,
whom they had never seen, but who knew them
quite well through Mr. Kirby’s and Mr. Adams’
descriptions. The two cousins had sent a large
box of chocolates to be shared by the six chums.</p>

<p>“Mother thinks,” said Mr. Williamson, watching
Artie trying to swallow a chocolate covered
cherry that threatened to drown him in syrup,
“that, since it is so warm to-day, we might drive
out and see Mrs. Wicks.”</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s go!” cried Fred. “We’ll
take her some of the chocolates—maybe she likes
candy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” he said. “But, Fred, stop
and consider the car a moment. It is a seven-passenger,
but how am I going to pack twelve into
the space reserved for seven?”</p>

<p>“It would be kind of crowded,” admitted Fred.
“I’m willing to stay at home, Dad. Let the
others go.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we arrange it this way,” said Mrs.
Williamson: “You children all stay at home
this time—you’ll find plenty to do to amuse yourselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
We won’t go till after lunch and we’ll be
back in time for supper. We feel that we’d like
to visit with Mrs. Wicks and take her a little
something, and it really wouldn’t be very interesting
for you. Then next time Daddy will take
the whole Riddle Club, and we grown-ups will
stay at home.”</p>

<p>So that was the way the plan was finally made,
and after an early lunch the fathers and mothers
drove off with baskets and boxes of goodies for
Mrs. Wicks, including some of the delicious chocolates
the children had insisted on sending her.</p>

<p>“Let’s tip old Riddle Chap over,” proposed
Artie, aching for a little exercise. “There’s no
use in waiting for him to melt away. Doesn’t he
look seedy, though?”</p>

<p>In truth, the old snowman did look seedy. He
had long ago lost his hat and his pine tree lay
on the ground at his feet. Gone were the letters,
R.C. In fact, he looked like a regular
tramp of a snowman.</p>

<p>“One, two, three!” called Fred, as the boys
leaned against the rapidly melting wreck.</p>

<p>At “three!” they gave a mighty push. Over
went the ball that had formed the snowman’s
body.</p>

<p>“Look how soft it is!” cried Polly, poking it
with her toe. “It’s nothing but slush and water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“What’s that?” Jess’s sharp eyes had caught
a glimpse of something dark.</p>

<p>She swooped down upon the pile of soft snow
and seized the something. A sharp tug, and she
had pulled out—her missing glove!</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” she shouted. “Look!
Here’s the glove I lost! It was in the snowman
all the time!”</p>

<p>The same thought came to Polly and Fred, and
they leaped for the fallen snowman’s body.</p>

<p>Fred reached it first, and his shoe hit something
that gave back a metallic sound.</p>

<p>He stooped and cleared away some of the slush.
Slowly he straightened up, something in his hands.</p>

<p>“It’s the bank!” screamed Margy. “Fred
found the bank! Look! Polly! Jess! Ward!
Artie! Look! Fred’s found the bank!”</p>

<p>Her excited clamor brought Carrie Pepper
from her house. As they crowded around him,
Fred saw Carrie come running through the snow.</p>

<p>“So she didn’t know a thing about it,” he
thought. “I’m glad I didn’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“Is the money there?” Ward kept asking.
“Are the dues inside, Fred?”</p>

<p>Well, the money was safe enough, Fred soon
discovered. And Jess’s glove, dried carefully behind
the kitchen range, was pronounced as good
as new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>While Fred wouldn’t say that good luck had
brought the bank back, he said he was willing Jess
should say good luck brought back her glove.</p>

<p>When the grown-ups came home at dusk, they
were astonished to have the car surrounded by
six dancing Indians who came tumbling out of
the Marley house without hats or coats. These
Indians danced madly around the car, singing a
chorus that at first could not be understood.</p>

<p>“The bank! The bank!” warbled the singers.
“Fred found the bank! And Jess’s glove—that’s
found, too! And the money is all right! And
the glove is dry and it isn’t hurt a bit!”</p>

<p>But when they finally understood, the fathers
and mothers were almost as excited as the members
of the Riddle Club.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Williamson took Fred
and the recovered bank and the other five members
of the club down to the bank, where an account
was opened in the name of the Riddle
Club.</p>

<p>“And wait!” said Fred, when he was the proud
custodian of the green-covered bankbook.
“Wait till the Conundrum Club hears of this!”</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
